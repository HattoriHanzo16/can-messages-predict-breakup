"need advice- i and my ex, we met at a music festival, the connection was pretty quick. tbh i wasn’t looking for anything serious with him but he showered me with so much love, adoration and care which i’d never experienced before (and craved for) he made me feel loved and worthy of love like never before. there was no official asking out thing that happened, we kind of hooked up on the first night of the festival and that’s just how we got together and were inseparable after that. we both lived in different countries and honestly it felt like a non issue and continued our thing and that’s when the covid19 happened. since we were locked inside our houses we practically spent our entire days on zoom and the connection kept growing deeper. things went on pretty well for 8months and then suddenly all the small issues started to get to me (i was also dealing with depression at the time)and after a month of dealing with those thoughts i decided to end the relationship but he was hell bent on trying to make this work. iooking back, i think more than love, i was addicted to him and everything he made feel. so of course i could let it go that easy and we kept trying but i wasn’t putting in 100% efforts because it felt forced. this continued for 2-3months more and he finally gave up and we agreed to part ways. but the connection we had was so strong we just couldn’t keep away from each other and continued to talk once a week and that’s when the real issue started. we weren’t together, or talking everyday but the way we spoke, our language, it was always full of love and care for each other as if we’re still together. we tried no contact etc but couldn’t sustain it. long story short, it’s been 2years since our break up and not much has changed. practically we can’t get back together cus either of us can’t move and he doesn’t want to put his efforts into a long distance relationship again, he says he has a soft spot for me and immense care but not ready to go thought all the difficulties of long distance all over again and also not ready to put in efforts to revive or erase the damage/baggage our toxic ish 3 year long situation-ship has caused (which is fair, don’t blame him and we have discussed this 2-3times) we’ve both been single since then and kind of stuck in a loop where it’s difficult to move on cause that’ll simply mean i’ll have to leave him behind and i don’t want that. he is such a nice person and i care for him so much, it almost hurts to think of a life without him and the thought of him meeting someone and moving on hurts cause that’s going to happen eventually and i’m not ready for it. we went for the same music festival again this month and we acted like we were a couple the entire time, it all happened naturally but after the fest and getting back home, he went back to being his long distance self where he shows love and care but doesn’t want discuss us potentially getting back together or giving us another chance. and here i am thinking how much longer is this going to continue for, i hate being stuck in this situation. what do i do?",3096.0,608.0,6.0,0.009868421052631578,0.019736842105263157,0.08223684210526316,1.0,0.0,0,1,0.8864982065615936,"need advice- i and my ex, we met at a music festival, the connection was pretty quick. tbh i wasn’t looking for anything serious with him but he showered me with so much love, adoration and care which i’d never experienced before (and craved for) he made me feel loved and worthy of love like never b",false_positive

"replaced like a used rag (a little vent about my last relationship — if you have similar experiences or advice, please share) i’m a 22-year-old guy and i spent 10 months seeing a 20-year-old guy. our relationship had many ups and downs before ending in what i believe—after hearing other stories—is one of the most sudden and brutal breakups ever. it started as a friends-with-benefits situation with the rule that we wouldn’t tell each other about other people we were seeing. it was a kind of “out of sight, out of mind” arrangement. after about a month, he broke that rule by inviting me and another guy to an outing. we talked about it, but things didn’t change deeply—i continued seeing others, and i think he did too. in october, it happened again: he invited that same guy for a night out with me, and a weird thing happened that disgusted me. even so, we carried on. i still occasionally hung out with others without his knowledge. a major moment occurred in december when he went out with another guy who wanted more than just a one-off hookup—he wanted something serious, they started dating. after that, we stopped talking for about a month, during which we saw each other four times. after that chapter, he came back to me and the relationship took a more serious turn—we started dating with the intention to become boyfriends. i stopped seeing other guys and focused on him. he didn’t. fast forward to may: i saw him with someone else. he assured me it was just a friend, but in the following days i found out they’d slept together. that’s when the breakup happened. he told me there were problems between us (fixable stuff) and that he’d started seeing the new guy because he didn’t feel carefree with me anymore. the new guy made him feel happier, and he wanted to see where that would go. he asked me to wait for him—and wanted us to stay friends. he threw me away carelessly. a month has passed since our last confrontation; he’s reached out to me four times. he’s playing confused, making it seem like he still doesn’t know what he wants. we both went to a friend’s birthday party and during a game of truth or dare, someone asked if he had feelings for anyone in the group. he refused to answer. meanwhile, other friends tell me things with the new guy are going well—he didn’t hesitate to call him “boyfriend” after just two weeks. that’s huge considering it took him months to call me that. it was brutal. i felt used more than ever before. i’m struggling to accept the end, and i don’t know how to approach the situation or let go.",2553.0,487.0,2.0,0.004106776180698152,0.002053388090349076,0.07597535934291581,0.0,0.0,1,0,-0.6174643285015334,"replaced like a used rag (a little vent about my last relationship — if you have similar experiences or advice, please share) i’m a 22-year-old guy and i spent 10 months seeing a 20-year-old guy. our relationship had many ups and downs before ending in what i believe—after hearing other stories—is o",false_negative

(long story short, that didn’t end up happening.) he said he was unhappy with her, that he felt like he was losing himself and slowly being stripped away by being with her. his dilemma was that they live together and recently signed a new lease and didn’t want to lose a bunch of money by breaking it. he told me they were basically just roommates now and didn’t have much of a physical relationship. he told me all the things he missed about being with me, that i was the best thing in his life. we met a couple weeks after he initially contacted me and it was like no time had passed. our connection and the spark we had was still there. we ended up having sex. i know it was wrong, but at the time i honestly felt like he would leave his girlfriend and we would end up together. over the next several months, we kept in contact. we stayed up late talking, flirting, etc. right before my birthday, in august, we talked about our feelings for each other. he told me that the way i made him feel was special and how grateful he was to have experienced it at all. that i was important to him. i told him i felt the same way, and that our connection was something i’d never experienced with anyone else and how much i missed it when we were apart. he wished me a happy birthday and then after that, communication instantly fell short. we didn’t talk for all of september. i figured maybe he needed space and wanted to give that to him. he called me late one night in october and we had phone sex. we met up for drinks a few days later. he told me that things with his girlfriend had gotten a little better, but he yet he still contacted me. i wasn’t sure what to say. at this point, it seemed clear to me that he was just using me to fill a hole in his relationship, which i wanted no part of. i knew i wanted all or nothing with him and didn’t want to be a part of an ongoing affair. thanksgiving weekend, he reached out again and we chatted for a bit, and then he tried to turn to the conversation over to sexting. i called him out on it, and told him i didn’t appreciate him using me like that and that i wanted to feel respected. he apologized right away, but that was the last time we spoke. yesterday i noticed that he deleted me on snapchat. i texted him today and asked him why and he read my message, didn’t respond and then just blocked my number. i’m honestly so confused and hurt. i hate to think that he just used me and is now discarding me. especially after all we’ve been through and the amount of times he’s told me how much he cares for me. i just feel stupid. i also still feel horrible about his girlfriend, to my knowledge she has no idea about what happened between us. i think she has the right to know but i don’t think it would be good coming from me. please keep the mean comments to a minimum. i know my part in this was wrong, but i honestly cared and loved him so much that i think i didn’t see the situation clearly. i guess… what do i do now?",3513.0,687.0,7.5,0.012711864406779662,0.005649717514124294,0.12146892655367232,1.0,0.0,0,1,0.24005619226086783,"my ex came back into my life for 6 months and then just randomly blocked me with no explanation. this past june, my (26f) ex (25m) contacted me after almost two years of being apart. we dated on and off for about 5 years and have known each other since high school. he since started a relationship wi",false_positive

"wife (30) of 4 years (8 together) cheated on me (35) with her male work colleague (50) apologies in advance for a long one. i recently found out that my wife of 4 years, together for 8 years, has been (emotionally) cheating on me with an older work colleague since christmas, which became physical in may this year. she told me that since last summer, she felt her feelings towards me wane, and that she no longer saw me romantically, but more as a blood relative. one of the reasons she put this down to was a lack of intimacy, sex and passion (mostly from my part). she also said she no longer saw me as man and that i was lacking ambition, mostly regarding my career. in my head, i think (possibly a big) part of the reason why this gradually started happening since last summer was due to multiple external factors (as well as internal ones within the relationship). last summer we bought out first house together, and were moving house for those months. the house also needs a lot of work done to it, which was causing us stress. in october, i was applying for a promotion, when suddenly my work declared they were in a massive deficit and job cuts were inevitable, as was a massive downsize all around. this still hasn't been fully resolved, and while i still have a job there, so much is uncertain. it is also frustrating that i missed the job opportunity, but that's life - i think this played a big role in her seeing me as less of a man, because i wasn't looking for other jobs and promotions and i was set in my ways in my hybrid job. she felt she was the breadwinner and the one wearing the trousers. and i put my career aside so she could focus on hers, as i knew this was important to her. it's not that i gave up on improving myself, but i saw it as more of a hiatus for her to prioritise her career. she also felt i let myself go in terms of hygiene (mostly because i get gas due to stomach issues, and apparently i burped in her face during intercourse once - i genuinely don't remember doing that, but will take her word for it). then, at christmas her family cat died around about the same time her mum found out she has cancer (currently being treated). in february this year, my family dog died and around the same time my wife ended up in a&e with extreme back pain, which we later discovered was due to herniated disks in her lower spine (something still causing issues). this was also a big reason for the lack of intimacy, and i saw her as fragile, due to the amount of pain she was in. we are separated now, after i recently discovered she cheated - which she finally admitted and broke down for me (i'm aware this is her account of things, and i should take this with a pinch of salt, as she is a liar). she said she noticed this older man since last christmas, and he gave her butterflies, something which no man had done since she was a teenager (which was a kick in the teeth for me, knowing she didn't feel that way about me), and since february she actively started pursuing him, finding excuses to speak to him and get to know him. eventually they started talking, she gave him her number and they went for coffee, where she admitted she was married, but confessed her feelings about him and lack of feelings towards me. this then blossomed. originally i became aware of her feelings towards him back in april, when i could sense distance growing between us, but she said she was confused (something she still says, even now). she seems him romantically and with interest, but me with love because of our history (not sexually). i initially offered couples therapy, even up until the end (when she finally admitted it got physical), but she always refused and admitted herself she had given up on our relationship. she said a reason for this is because she had suggested therapy in the past to discuss our issues, by which she was referring to me, but ai refused. she said i was a ""mommy's boy"", because i take care of my mum and she felt i always prioritised my mum (and my other family members) before her - which i disagree with, as i feel i prioritise my family in general, of which she was a part of - but that's her views. in may, our relationship came to a slow death when i caught her lying about spending the night away with him. she said she was with her friend, but had in fact went away for a romantic night in a different city with him, staying overnight. when she got caught, she insisted it had only been kissing and that they stayed in a hostel. which deep down i knew was rubbish, but a part of me wanted to believe her. she also got upset at me for spying on her. i left our house, went back to my mum's to get some space. my family found out and obviously their views towards her changed. this upset my wife and i think brought the relationship even further to the point of no return. i also said some things in anger, but eventually apologised (for what i said) once i calmed down. i accept that the relationship is dead, and what we once had is now lost, but i can't help the feeling of the rug being pulled from under my feet. before all this, we were finally getting ready to plan for children (which she said she always wanted with me), and though i'm glad there are no kids involved, as this would be so much harder, i feel frustrated (mostly at myself for my failings in the relationship, as i'm aware it takes two - despite the fact her actions were the final blow), at the situation of our relationship and with my current circumstances. i was finally at a point in life where i felt everything was coming together and now i feel robbed. i feel inadequate because i'm 35, lost my marriage and wife, my home (for now - i plan to contest this eventually, as we co-own it), the imagined family i was planning for and the fact i am back living at my mum's, which just makes me feel like such a loser. i'm also frustrated and feel my situation makes me seem less desirable when the time comes and when i feel ready to move on to a new relationship, which admittedly isn't now and i know situations change. i'm also so confused, because all of the things she's done: cheating, being with an older man and with someone who has family tona previous marriage or partner, are all things she was totally against in the past. she also made me feel bad about having female friends, often got jealous and would say things to me about how many other men noticed her, were eyeing her up etc. i'm aware this comes from her own insecurities, but can't help but feel odd about her actions, since they show me a different woman from the one i married. i guess this is mostly a vent, but im also looking for ways to help cope. i'm considering therapy, but will need to save up for a few sessions as this isn't cheap. i'm not suicidal or anything, just severely deflated. i should also point out all communication has stopped, except for the essentials, like legal matters and the house.",3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.006191950464396285,-0.0046439628482972135,0.08513931888544891,0.0,0.0,1,0,-0.06355066297351114,"wife (30) of 4 years (8 together) cheated on me (35) with her male work colleague (50) apologies in advance for a long one. i recently found out that my wife of 4 years, together for 8 years, has been (emotionally) cheating on me with an older work colleague since christmas, which became physical in",false_negative

"am i crazy? was i manipulated? 20 yr female. need help and input. please! hi everyone, a month ago i went through the most horrific breakup ever. i don’t even know if i’d call it a breakup but rather a straight up abandonment. and i can’t help but overthink the situation, but as each day passes i am slowly realizing i was potentially manipulated. context: when we first started talking things were great, a little too great (suspected love bombing). he was so verbally and physically affectionate, excessively now that i look back. immediately saying things like “i can’t imagine my life without you”, mentioning marriage and making plans for the future. two weeks in he asked me to meet his parents, i set my boundary that this was too soon. the weekend they came to visit he texted me saying “my dad really wants to meet you” and guilt tripping me. of course, i cracked. then, he proceeded to say i love you around the same time. i knew it was way too soon, but i said it back because i didn’t want to hurt him. the first time we had drunk s*x (i was sober) i set the boundary i didn’t want to do any backdoor stuff if you know what i mean. it seemed like he lost control, and he tried to eitherway. when i expressed discomfort with it, he started sobbing saying extreme things like “i need to go to rehab i’m a terrible person” and slamming walls in my bathroom. i felt guilt and forgave him. about two weeks after this, i tried to play a small stupid prank on him and he slightly pushed my chest. after i laid in his bed sobbing from shock and confusion, he laid next to me hugging me and saying “i’m sorry i blackout when i’m angry” and claimed he didn’t remember pushing me. he then went to shower and said “i hope you’re still here when i come back out” because he knew i was contemplating leaving. i stayed because the thought of how he would feel coming out of the bathroom and seeing an empty bed hurt my heart. as time progressed there were moments he would snap at me out of no where for seemingly no reason. like super angry in the flip of a switch. even when i was just trying to help. he then apologized and said he “does this all the time” and he’s “working on it”. whenever he did something that made me uncomfortable and i confronted it, he would break down and sob. i’m talking like meltdown. all of a sudden overtime i noticed he like started getting distant out of no where. less compliments. less physical touch. less everything. his face got really cold if that makes sense. just like emotionless. about a week before he broke up with me he stopped texting me. making me feel crazy for wanting to know what he was thinking. he told me he needed a night alone to think of how he can “be a better partner for me”. he kept extending these nights, with no reasoning just leaving me confused. he said i “wasn’t respecting his boundary for space” when in reality all i wanted was clarification to settle my anxiety. i stayed up for 48 hours at one point from anxiety over not knowing what was going on. a few days before the breakup, we were having an argument and i asked to step away alone for a second to catch my breath and clear my head before responding. i went into my bathroom. he came busting in 4 times, pushing me and pushing me despite me sobbing. i kept begging for space and he continued to berate me. i snapped and i said “i’m done with your shit”. he was like “wow i cannot believe you said that to me” and began to attack on me for that. i said “that’s reactive gaslighting and you’re gaslighting me”. he looks me dead in the face and says “no you’re gaslighting me.” was i??? i was just so hurt. i told him to leave my room that night. few days later, he says “i’m going to come to your room so we can talk”. he kept postponing the time, almost to deliberately hurt me. when he finally comes to my room, he says we’re done. starts packing up all his stuff. he goes “don’t block me from leaving”, as if i would ever do that. treating me like i’m crazy. i was begging him to stay. he looks at me and says “go get the help that you so badly need”. but before that he said “you’re the love of my life” while packing his things up. as he left my room i said “i love you”. he says “i can’t say the same” and walks off. he texted me the day before saying i love you. like how can you not love someone anymore that easily? i texted him right after he left “i love you and this relationship, and this is worth working for and saving”. he responds “i loved you and i loved our relationship.” and then proceeds to block me on everything. literally everything. less than 48 hours later he texts my roommate and says “i still love her. is she okay? i know i shouldn’t care but it hurts to know what she’s going through”. and you told me you didn’t love me less than 48 hours before? a few days before he ended things he told me he could see himself having kids with me. he made me feel crazy while breaking up with me like i was some psychotic person. i can’t help but wonder if i was in the wrong. yes there were moments where i was too anxious and that displayed in my actions. but i never had any bad intentions. i just needed reassurance. i blocked him incase he reaches out. i am closer with my friends again and weirdly enough i am talking more than i did when i was with him and being more like my normal extroverted self. has anyone had similar experiences? how can someone go from supposedly loving you to leaving you in the worst way imaginable? especially after i had opened up about my fear of abandonment due to my childhood trauma? about a week and a half ish before our breakup he woke me up at night because he had a nightmare i completely ghosted him and blocked him on everything, and he told me it was horrible to dream about. so how could someone possibly do that to me and put me through their “nightmare”?

"i’m feeling stuck and emotionally down in my relationship. am i asking for too much? i 27 f have been in a relationship for 9 months with a man 27 m i’m feeling stuck and emotionally worn down in my relationship. am i asking for too much? from a different nationality. in the mid stage of the relationship, i stayed with him and his mom for about 2 months while i searched for a better apartment. he was supportive during that time, and i appreciated it. i’ve since moved into my own place. he still visits a few times a week, stays over for a night or two, and then goes home. every time he leaves, i feel empty and emotionally disconnected. i’ve realized that i want more than just a part-time relationship i want marriage, kids, and a stable, shared life. when i brought up the idea of living together, he said i have “expectations” he can’t meet, like wanting a partner with a degree or a better job (which i said when we started the relationship) he also said he doesn't want me to carry the financial burden, even though i offered to split expenses. what hurts more is how he treats me sometimes. he often corrects me telling me how to walk, eat, or do things as if i don’t know how. it feels condescending, like i’m being treated as someone incapable or unintelligent. when i try to explain how something he said hurt me, he later mimics my emotional response in a totally different situation. he’s not intentionally cruel—he brings me treats, spends money (i spend too) helped me move, and seems to care—but most of his time with me is either spent in intimacy or on his computer. there's very little emotional or future-focused conversation. i feel like we connect only physically. there’s no depth or meaningful talk—almost like a teenage relationship where feelings are there, but nothing is really built. meanwhile, i’ve been living independently for years. i manage my own life, home, and responsibilities. he still relies on his mom for cooking and laundry. i often feel like i’m in a strange role—doing the emotional labor and still being treated like i’m the one who’s clueless. i’m not sure if this is just a temporary mismatch or a deeper incompatibility. i care for him, but i feel like i’m the only one thinking about long-term stability. i feel alone, confused, and unsure about the path forward. am i expecting too much, or is this relationship not truly meeting my needs?",2394.0,445.0,2.0,0.0044943820224719105,0.006741573033707865,0.1101123595505618,3.0,0.0,1,0,-0.18521254288231154,i’m feeling stuck and emotionally down in my relationship. am i asking for too much? i 27 f have been in a relationship for 9 months with a man 27 m i’m feeling stuck and emotionally worn down in my relationship. am i asking for too much? from a different nationality. in the mid stage of the relatio,false_negative

i [f22]haven't been feeling my best i just got into a new relationship and he's [m21] doing the similar things my last partner did and i told myself i will never go through that again... so my current boyfriend has been triggering me to the point where i’m shutting down i get my past is my problem but i’ve told him things i don’t like and he hasn’t changed anything and i know it takes time but the way i work is at least taking steps when you are told there’s an issue. everything is the same in my eyes because nothing hasn’t been done. example 1 i told him i don’t like him following of girls because it makes me feel physically sick. and makes me want to relapse my ed. and found porn tabs all in his phone. his response that was the old me and i don’t consume that stuff. backstory my last partner consumed porn very bad to the point where i saw him looking up local prostitutes and when talking about it he called me insecure. my new bf knows this example 2 i told him i’m kinda uncomfortable with him following his exes his response i only follow them because we didn’t end on bad terms backstory my last partner started following his last partner and laughing in my face when i wanted to talk about it and told me to not worry about it that he hasn’t talked to her yet. again my bf knows this example 3 he was on the phone last night with his friend and his friend said tell that b!tch to go home so we can play ow mind you i don’t mind i just usually sleep when they play but my bf uses me as an excuse to not play with his friends at times i told his friend to basically stfu and he asked why my bf always has his phone on speaker and my bf didn’t say anything at all. he didn’t say hey man don’t talk like that about my gf nothing i had to speak up. backstory my last partner would let his friends and family talk shit about me and never stood up for me now every time i’m upset he asks me what he can do and he will do whatever i tell him to make me happy but i don’t want that it makes me feel like i’m controlling. and in my head and heart i know if we take that path he will soon get tired of this relationship and i don’t want that. he wants to stay together and says he loves me a lot and i just don’t know what to do i want to protect myself. sorry to whoever is reading this i know it’s messy.. -thank you,2326.0,492.0,1.0,0.0020325203252032522,0.0,0.13211382113821138,0.0,0.0,1,0,-1.7537703125486128,i [f22]haven't been feeling my best i just got into a new relationship and he's [m21] doing the similar things my last partner did and i told myself i will never go through that again... so my current boyfriend has been triggering me to the point where i’m shutting down i get my past is my problem b,false_negative
"my “friend” is hanging out with my abusive ex. guess she’s an ex friend now too? i broke up with my emotionally abusive ex back in december after he lashed out at me for not giving him $5, which i knew was to buy beer. he is an alcoholic, lost his job several times, threw up blood, etc. i finally set a boundary around not giving him money anymore because i felt that i was enabling his addiction. he lashed out at me, called me a bunch of names, said he hated me etc, he cheated on me as well. after he lashed out at me, i said we were done and he could come get his things, he proceeded to tell me that he took pills and was going to end his life if i didn’t show up - this was a recurring thing that would happen. i always wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt, but he’d lie to me about going to therapy and aa. i finally blocked him in january and he proceeded to contact my roommates to try and get in contact with me, threatening to show up at our house, resulting in us needing to get a security camera because he previously slashed my last roommates tires. (she was crazy but that does not justify it.) and i have been no contact with him for coming up on nearly 5 months now. no contact has helped me a lot but there are some people involved in this friend group with him who i tried to stay friends with because i valued those relationships, however it seems they don’t value it the same way. i told the two girls in the group who i thought were friends, sarah and hannah, everything that happened with my ex and they even saw the messages he had blew up my phone with and they were shocked. hannah informed me my ex hadn’t been paying her boyfriend rent for months and she was upset (this was in march.) then, a few weeks ago, sarah texts me and invites me to her birthday party but says my ex is going to be there and she “totally understands the situation” and can let me know when he’s going to be there so i know when “all’s clear.” i replied and told her thank you for the invite but i don’t feel very safe going if he’s going to be around. she ignored it and never replied, two weeks go by, and today she posts a video of her hanging out with him and joking around, laughing while he’s helping her move something like wtf? am i crazy here? i already felt angry with her because she knows he’s an alcoholic and is inviting him to her birthday where there’s alcohol, then on top of it expecting me to work around that. i just am feeling super lonely in all this and like everything that happened to me is being minimized.",2543.0,510.0,7.5,0.025490196078431372,-0.0058823529411764705,0.09411764705882353,3.0,0.0,1,0,-0.0850920529758396,"my “friend” is hanging out with my abusive ex. guess she’s an ex friend now too? i broke up with my emotionally abusive ex back in december after he lashed out at me for not giving him $5, which i knew was to buy beer. he is an alcoholic, lost his job several times, threw up blood, etc. i finally se",false_negative

i need some breakup advice because i’m so sad i was in a ldr with a man i actually met on reddit in january of 2022. we met at a time where i really needed someone and he was there for me. he initiated everything and contacted me first. we talked every single day and moved to snapchat where we started calling each other as he drove home/ to work each day. he sent me flowers and gifts and we fell in love. every so often we would video call and they would last for about 6 hours at a time. he was the most kind and loving and attractive man i have ever met and us falling for each other was easy. we made a plan to meet in august of 2022 but he ended up getting a promotion at work and couldn’t take any time off for a while. we would have met sooner but neither of us had a passport and so we had to wait for months. he lives in america and so he wanted me to be with him for thanksgiving and christmas but since our plans got delayed to meet in august and he was supposed to come to me first that didn’t get to happen either. and so our new plan was april 2023. i was so excited because we were waiting to be in person to be officially boyfriend and girlfriend. i considered this man to be the one. we had talked about having a life together and who would move to who and babies etc. throughout this time of me knowing him i noticed he would lie about things and only tell me the truth once i found out (there are a lot of things he lied about and i can explain some of them if you want). i’ll fast forward a little bit but 2 days ago i found out that he never broke up with his ex like he told me he had. they have been together for almost 8 years and engaged for almost 3. on facebook i saw photos of them at a wedding in august of 2022 and she was wearing her engagement ring. i messaged her and asked and she told me they have never broken up not even for a second. they also just moved into an apartment together about 2 weeks ago. he immediately deleted every social media account he had. now i have been left absolutely devastated because i can’t believe this is real. that everything we ever had was a lie. that he had no plans to ever visit me. i can’t stop crying and it hurts so badly because i considered him the one. i want him back and i want a life with him but i can only imagine they will stay together and work things out. right now i just need comfort and advice. how do i get through this pain.
