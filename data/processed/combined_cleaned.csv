"been on both sides of a breakup now, here’s what i’ve realized. two weeks ago i ended a nearly 2 year relationship. it hit me that i’ve now been on both sides of a breakup and i’ve learned a lot. about two years ago i got dumped. looking back, i could tell she was slowly losing attraction for me but i was naive. we stopped having sex for months and i didn’t see the writing on the wall. it hurt like hell when it ended. i felt blindsided, rejected, and crushed. now in this recent relationship, i was the one who slowly lost attraction. i ended things and it completely blindsided her. she was like a golden retriever. sweet, loyal, and full of love. she had no idea it was coming. watching her break down was brutal. i cared about her, just not in that way anymore. i won’t lie, being the one to end it was hard. it messed with my head. but to be real, it was nowhere near as painful as being dumped. i don’t know how people pretend they’re the same. they’re not. still, breakups suck in any role. you’re separating from someone you once loved, someone you shared your life with. that grief is real. but here’s the thing i keep coming back to. we all only get one life. we will all die one day. this pain we feel right now is temporary. it’s heavy, but it’s not forever. and if we really think about it, how can we blame someone for leaving if they’re unhappy? yes, it hurts. yes, it feels personal. but they didn’t choose who they are or who they’re drawn to. none of us did. a lot of it comes down to genetics, brain chemistry, timing, emotional baggage, things we don’t control. in a different life, maybe you had better genes or more charisma and that person would have stayed. maybe you’d be perfect for them. but you didn’t get that life. and that’s painful. but it doesn’t mean you’re unlovable. it just means they weren’t your person. i wish we could all carry this awareness. i wish it could protect us from the pain. but heartbreak isn’t logical. it’s emotional. and feeling it is part of being human.",breakup,1,2014.0,403.0,7.5,0.019851116625310174,0.0,0.07444168734491315,1.0,0.0
"i saw my ex with his new gf i broke up with him on may 2nd. by june 6th he was in another relationship. we were together 4.5 years. i was hurt by hearing this. but then i saw them together. i can’t get over it. i can’t get how he moved on so quickly. i was fine until i saw them together. now i can’t eat. i can’t sleep. it’s all i think about. i wonder if they were talking before we were over. he was so distant with me before i ended it. there was a disconnect. was she that reason? i saw her, she’s not even attractive.",breakup,1,523.0,115.0,2.0,0.017391304347826087,-0.008695652173913044,0.1565217391304348,1.0,0.0
"didn’t think losing someone who was already distant would hurt this much we hadn’t really been ""us"" for a while. the texts got shorter, the calls less frequent, and the silence between us started feeling louder than the words. still, when we finally ended it, it hit me like a punch i wasn’t ready for. it’s strange how you can miss someone who stopped showing up long ago. i keep replaying moments that felt small back then but now feel like signs i ignored. the way they started pulling away. the way i tried harder when i should’ve let go. i’m not here for pity i just needed to say it out loud. to someone. to anyone.",breakup,1,621.0,123.0,0.0,0.0,-0.008130081300813009,0.0975609756097561,0.0,0.0
"7 year relationship gone in an instant. i moved citys to live together and had our own apartment with two cats but now that is all gone in a instant. i walked into our bedroom and found her naked in bed with a close friend of mine last night. she woke up and heard me enter the bedroom and, i walked back out and got into my car and drove 4 hours to my familys home going 150mph down the highway nearly the whole way. i'll have least 3 speeding tickets but my mental state was so gone that, i nearly drove my car into a tree on a country road last night as my suicide thoughts returned because of the stock as, i was completely numb to the point, i didn't even cry. it's been 12 hours since this and, i haven't slept a single bit. i have received 54 missed calls and 132 messages from her since last night so yeah. my life that, i once had completely fell apart last night of building a life for myself in a different city and we got the same social circle. i turned 25 two days ago so thats my birthday surprise, i suppose. i have thought about, what to do next so ill do this... i will go back to our place and get all my things so literally everything in the apartment when she is at work and get a moving truck for everything. i will contact my landlord to finish my tendency so she will have to leave the apartment in a couple days. i will take my cats also as, they are under my name and move back home to my parents house for the next couple months so i can rebuild my life from scratch again. after this, i will hit the gym hard to get as fit as possible over the next couple months to completely focus on my own development and try build a social circle once again. i have gained nearly 50 pounds in the last 7 years so, i am completely out of shape so all this pain and hurt will be my motivation. i will not rebound nor speak to another girl until, i am ready for it and my life is on the right track and i have lost this weight that destroyed my own self confidence. i suppose the outcome of this would be a massive redemption plan for myself so maybe one today, i can love the right person and be the true me once again as, i haven't been the real me in many years. i entered the relationship depressed and battling mental health like depression but, i won't let this beat me. i will post a r/ glow-up in 6 months time so throw me a follow if you guys are interested in it because, i will achieve all my goals by then hopefully. thank you for reading 💪",breakup,1,2465.0,484.0,2.0,0.004132231404958678,-0.004132231404958678,0.11983471074380166,0.0,0.0

"if they really loved you, you'll regret breaking up, forever. (1.5 years on) i've been in therapy for a good 1.5 years now, and began therapy following breaking up with my girlfriend of 3 years. through therapy i have come to understand that the problems in the relationship were mostly with me and caused by me; i placed blame with her at the time and convinced myself that we were fundamentally incompatible. i treated her so badly, which i am ashamed of. i have never been loved by anyone in the way that she loved me. she supported me through real hardship, taking so much time and emotional energy to speak and listen to me day upon day, despite the kind of toll this must have taken. she cared her me so deeply, and showed this in so many big and little ways. she celebrated every victory of mine, showed so much encouragement and enthusiasm with everything i wanted to pursue. she was so beautiful that she would be complemented by strangers. she was so intelligent, a deep and critical thinker. she was completely committed and put everything into our relationship. she was my closest and dearest friend as well as my girlfriend. after living together in a real apartment, our relationship was almost over. i criticised her daily, was passive aggressive and there were times i had shouted at her, called her names, told her i hated her. no matter what she showed up with love and understanding, making every effort to solve the problems i was bringing up to her. i am so ashamed. at the time i blamed her for being the one that was i the wrong, that she was disrespectful and immature... anything to avoid accountability. we stayed together, we moved out of our apartment and ended up being long distance because of our careers, yet i allowed this to become the final reason as to why i should call it quits, despite that there was a clear vision for when the long distance would end. when we broke up i was back dating straight away. she was the problem after all and i didn't care. or, at least i thought so. 3 months later it hit me like a bus, i had lost the most special and wonderful person i had ever met. not only that, i really hurt a person who had shown constant love and care for me. i lost something that i don't believe i will ever find again (i haven't yet, i've had a few short term flings that go nowhere...and nobody comes close, or ever will, come close to her) i don't have the words to express the regret i feel for losing her. she is in a new relationship now and very happy. i would give anything to go back and reverse my decision and make up for the pain i caused.",breakup,1,2597.0,481.0,2.0,0.004158004158004158,0.016632016632016633,0.10395010395010396,0.0,0.0

"my mind is my biggest enemy, not my ex (unfortunately). 14 months post breakup my ex (m) broke up with me (f) nearly a year and two months ago out of the blue with barely any warning signs. relationship was only 4 months long. i haven't seen him in a year, haven't contacted him in half a year (broke no contact for his birthday and trying to seek closure, to no avail). blocked him on everything because the thought of seeing what he looks like now could send me into a panic attack. i've had panic attacks periodically throughout the last year all triggered by reminders of him. i still feel like he haunts me and everything i do and everyone i talk to. he has a new (not even new, they've now been dating for longer than we ever had) girlfriend. moved on with life of course like what a normal healthy person should do. i try every single day to get over it. regular therapy and meds (had anxiety attacks and insomnia bc my mind would constantly bring up thoughts about him leading me to spiral) and everything. it's been like this for the last year. it's gotten to a point where my mind has developed a new coping mechanism (delusion) to make sense of all these overwhelming thoughts: part of me believes that he'll come back some day. by all logic i know this isn't true and it isn't healthy, but in the depth of my suffering my brain can only supply this logic to numb the pain, even if it's delusional. i think deep down i still believe that things must make sense. that this suffering must mean something, about to something, conclude with something. while i know that the healthy, healed answer to this should be that this entire breakup saga should mold me into a new and healed person, with deeper insights into myself, the other part of me can't help but think of the what ifs and the hypotheticals. i know this journey of healing is something that i must deal with on my own but part of me sees my past year of failures and thinks that that must mean one thing: he has to come back for me to heal. it's made me feel worse overtime. a year and two months have passed and by now i /should/ be over it. and yet it still haunts me so deeply and drives me to the most delusional insane mind spaces that i never thought i would be in. i want to say that i hope he's happy and living life healthily but i can't help but feel resentful that he is allowed to move on normally while im stuck here, 14 months later.",breakup,1,2417.0,458.0,7.5,0.019650655021834062,0.002183406113537118,0.08733624454148471,0.0,0.0

"still love my ex, but her dad died shortly after we reconnected — should i reach out again? i (23m) reconnected with my ex (22f) earlier this year. we’ve known each other since we were 16. i was her first boyfriend, her first everything. we dated in 2022 and broke up in january 2024. after i decided to breakup, we continued talking and seeing each other occasionally. this continued until march of this year. she decided we needed to move on. in april we met up and i told her i still loved her, and we had a long conversation about everything. the way the conversation went it seemed like we would have gotten back together. we both agreed if we had just talked about everything that was happening we’d still be together. it was bad timing with our final exams, and she said it hurt that she couldn’t give me the answer i wanted to hear right now. she agreed to think about everything until after our exams. but then, after 3 weeks, the day before i was going to ask her out, her father took his own life very unexpectedly. i didn’t pressure her — i went to the removal and funeral quietly. i posted her out a small care package just with her favourite sweets and she texted me a short thank you for it. about two weeks later, i texted her just asking if she wanted to go for a walk and a hot chocolate it was really just a low-pressure way to say i’m still here for her. she left the message on delivered. i haven’t reached out since — it’s been 6 weeks. i’ve seen her out nearly every weekend since. she’s always with her brother and his friends or family, never with just her own close friends. she actively avoids any situation where we might talk or bump into each other. but at the moment her circle is so tight and i only think her mum knows that we were meeting up or had that conversation. it would be very hard for her to reach out to me, even if she wanted. she hasn’t made any effort to contact me, even though i know she’s active online. i’ve seen her out in a nightclub with her friends and family dancing so i know she’s able to go out. here’s my dilemma: i still love her. i don’t want to pressure her at all, especially after what she’s been through. but i’m stuck in limbo. part of me says: if she’s able to go out clubbing, she’s also able to reply with a simple, kind message like “thanks, but i need time.” i feel like i’ve been ghosted, which hurts especially given our history. i know she’s going through something horrendous but at the same time, if your able to go out dancing with strangers your able to send a text back. it’s not like our last time talking it was a fight. it was me telling her i love her and want to be with her. so do i text her next week with something light like: “hey, just wanted to check in and see how you’re doing. hope you’ve been holding up okay.” or do i wait a few more weeks and send something a bit more honest, like: “hey, i know it’s been a while. i’ve been giving you space, but i still feel the same way i did back in april. i just wanted to say that, and i hope you’re doing okay.” i know most people will say just move on. i just want to be able to hold my head high and say i did everything i could for her and with respect. but most importantly, i want to leave the door open so she knows if in 6 months time or whatever she could reach out. i want her to know that i’m not moving on because of this tragic event unless she wants me to. appreciate any perspective on this. tl;dr i reconnected with my ex and her dad died tragically. i’m stuck in limbo not know what to do. afraid to move on incase she still has feelings but can’t realise them, or if it’s over and she doesn’t care.",breakup,1,3652.0,687.0,7.5,0.010810810810810811,0.010810810810810811,0.1,1.0,0.0

"vent on using online dating to get over an ex for context my gf and i knew each other for 4 years as close friends and dated for 1.5, the relationship was for the most part great and had no real glaring issues, she was my best friend. as time went on though some basic incompatibilities started to surface and we also just started growing a little distant. i often felt like my needs weren’t being met in terms of intimacy, which led to a lot of problems on my end due to the lack of feeling truly close and wanted by her on top of my insecurities. we ended the relationship mutually after it kind of reached a boiling point for both of us. we agreed to remain friends, which has proved to be very difficult but now we are at the stage where we’re going no contact for a while. i miss her a tremendous amount and a week or two after the break up i started using dating apps, to distract myself but i would constantly go back and forth between feeling guilty and deleting my account and deciding i need to move on and continuing to use them. this is more so just a vent than a call for advice but i feel extremely guilty now for ‘moving on’ so quickly as she is in a way still in my life in some capacity even as a friend. i miss her a great deal but in my mind the relationship was over long before we actually ended things officially. i had a couple matches but when it came down to it, flirting with someone else kind of disgusted me — the moment i have actual time to think about what im doing, i feel disgusted with myself. as much as i miss her and would like to distract myself i think it is best to just sit with the pain. for anyone else going through this; dating apps won’t really make you feel any better, only distract you for a while and then most likely make you feel worse.",breakup,1,1788.0,353.0,5.0,0.014164305949008499,0.0056657223796034,0.0821529745042493,0.0,0.0
"is it okay that my ex bf of 5 years started dating another girl only a month after a breakup me and my ex broke up 2 months ago, i needed some time to be alone i didn’t know where our relationship was going. sooo, it’s been 2 months of no contact. i believe that he loved me, and i feel like i betrayed him in a way, that i was confused and needed some time alone. so yesterday we met, and i told him what i felt throughout that time i feel awful, lost and empty. i don’t want any men, i was trying to go on a date 2 times. guys that i went out with were cool, but i don’t want anyone. all i can do is think about my ex. i told him all of that, i didn’t expect anything from him. but when he told me that he’s already trying to build a relationship with another girl just after a month after a break up. why do i feel like that? empty and depressed. but he doesn’t? he loved me and move on so quickly, how? can someone tell me if it’s okay for a guy to move on so quickly? thing is also, i told him that i need some time, and want to go to therapy to clear what’s on my mind. and left more than a half of my clothes in our(now his apartment) and he having sex in our apartment where my clothes everywhere??? so freaking sad",breakup,1,1223.0,262.0,7.5,0.03435114503816794,0.003816793893129771,0.1297709923664122,5.0,0.0
"he says he still loves me, but slept with someone else right after we broke up. do i give him another chance? hey everyone, i really need some advice because i’m at a major crossroads and i have no idea which way to go. this is gonna be a long post. here’s the backstory: i was in a relationship with my ex for a year. it was one of those really healthy, solid relationships, tons of open communication, emotional support, no real fights, just really safe and good. the kind of relationship i always dreamed of but never really had until then. about a month ago, he decided to break up with me. and honestly, the reasons were somewhat valid. i unintentionally triggered some deep emotional wounds of his, after he had (also unintentionally) triggered some of mine. something just snapped between us. it felt like everything we had built, this strong foundation, just collapsed in an instant. after the breakup, i tried to offer him support, to be there for him emotionally, without pressuring him or expecting anything. but he chose to walk away. meanwhile, i was absolutely wrecked, crying all the time, feeling like a stray dog left out in the rain, hoping every single day that he’d come back, that we could heal from this pain together, and come out stronger. but instead of numbing the pain with distractions or rebound stuff, i chose to fully sit with it and feel it. i started going to therapy 3 times a week, just to really process everything and heal in a real way. i isolated myself completely, only started going out and talking to friends again a week ago. i was devastated. then, last week… he reached out. he sent me these super emotional messages, saying he realized how much he still loves me, how he wants to come back, build a future together, that i’m his “everything”, all those big sweet words. for a second, it felt like my dream was coming true. i was happy again. but in the days that followed, it was super hard to actually communicate. i think he was overwhelmed, and to be fair, we both went through something pretty intense. now comes the part that broke me. 4 days after our breakup, one of my close friends called me and said he saw my ex out with another woman and they were acting really close. my first thought was, “nah, that must’ve been his sister or something.” he’s always been this super loyal, grounded guy. i even remember a conversation where he told me he’d never be able to date someone else just a few weeks after a breakup. so i didn’t believe it. but that same friend called me 2 more times about similar sightings. and even then, i still held onto hope that it wasn’t him. i know. delusional. fast forward to yesterday. he finally admitted that, yeah, he did hook up with someone else. i don’t even know how to explain how that made me feel. i'm just so disappointed. so betrayed. i know that technically we weren’t together anymore, so i shouldn't feel this hurt, but it was just 4 fucking days after our breakup. and it wasn’t just any breakup, it was painful, emotional, and raw. my whole body is rejecting this reality. i get that sometimes people do stuff to escape pain when it gets too heavy. but i can’t stop asking myself: is that all i meant to you? was that really love? just 4 days? and the worst part is, i have no way of knowing for sure if there wasn’t already something going on between them before we split. he says there wasn’t, but... how can i trust that? i went from praying for him to come back every day… to now feeling like all the trust i had in him is shattered. i never thought i’d be the kind of person to post something like this here and be that girl who asks people ""should i forgive him?"", but… here i am. i’m so confused and i really need some honest opinions. what would you do if you were in my shoes? how would you process this? would you give him another chance… or walk away with your dignity? sorry if this post is all over the place, i feel all over the place. my brain is a mess right now and i just really need some outside perspective. thank you for reading!",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.01963350785340314,0.009162303664921465,0.08507853403141362,5.0,0.0
i stalk him everyday i think about him and his new girl having sex. i dream about him. he cheated on me with her and she knew. i get angrier and angrier everyday. i look at all his social medias. i genuinely cannot go a day without him being in my mind. i hate seeing him live a good life while i’m still struggling with mine. i am completely disgusted in myself. even when i’m hanging out with my friends or on a facetime call i still have the strong urge to stalk. if don’t do it i get extreme anxiety and i feel like i’m going to throw up. i’ve seen some stuff with him and his girlfriend and he’s sent me them just to brag in my face so it’s not like seeing them together makes me sick anymore or makes my heart race. i think the only way for me to get out of this is suicide and if they stay together any longer i might kill myself. i know people say to be ok with being by myself but that was my first boyfriend and i’ve been by myself for most of my life.,breakup,1,962.0,206.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14563106796116504,0.0,0.0

"for anyone thinking of going back to their exes…this is for you. today, i had a massive crash out because i badly missed my ex and i wanted to get back together with him. i talked to chatgpt and it said that my desire to go back to my ex is only a temporary measure that my brain is seeking so that i could undo the pain that i am experiencing. i’ve been reflecting about my desire to go back to my ex and i suddenly thought of this: “if i get back together with him, there’s a chance that we may breakup again like what happened with my first ex. that means i would have to go through this pain all over again. i don’t want to feel this pain ever again.” my breakup with my second ex is by far the most painful experience i have ever endured in my life. i’m usually a very vindictive person but the pain i endured had me telling my best friends “i wouldn’t wish this pain on anyone else.” this pain is unimaginable, unbearable, and literally soul destroying. it seriously demotivates me and drags me down to the pits of hell. although it’s hard to stop all thoughts of going back to my second ex, the thought of me going through this pain all over again helps me manage it. even if i think of the many what ifs that we could do to make our relationship happier and better than before, there is still a possibility of breaking up again. i already broke up with my ex. who’s to say that we won’t breakup again? even if we did put more effort and we were able to last a few more months or years because of it, the reason why we broke up in the first place *may* still haunt us in the future. and when we breakup again, i imagine it’s going to hurt more than now. i don’t want to experience this pain ever again. it’s like i’m burning alive inside and out, and i can’t do anything to put out the fire. i don’t want to pour all this effort into moving on only for me to go back to my ex and experience this pain all over again.",breakup,1,1923.0,397.0,7.5,0.037783375314861464,-0.022670025188916875,0.12846347607052896,1.0,0.0

"how do i move on when i don't know why it ended? will try to make this long story short but me (m32) started dating a co-worker (m20) last year. we worked together for 2 years and over the last year we became really close friends, i was in a relationship at the time and ended things with my ex partner, not because of my co-worker but because i realised i allowed myself to stay in an emotionally abusive relationship for way too long and finally found the strength to move on from that. things were tough as i was living with my ex-partner at the time and having to find a new place to live etc was very stressful. my co-worker was always there for me and helped me with moving etc. eventually i found the courage to ask him out on a date, i convienced myself that there was no way he was going to ever say yes, there was a big age gap, but as we spent more time together i realised i was falling for him so had to ask just to get it out of my mind, to my suprise he agreed to go on a date with me. we went on a date and started dating, few people at work caught us kissing in a club one night so all our over colleagues eventually found out, which was fine he had no issues with it. we have both never dated someone who we were really good friends with first and this was something we both experienced for the first time. we dates for a few months and i was seeing him a lot at work and outside of work. he never told his parents about me, i asked if it was to do with the age gap and he told me it wasn't, even though we are both out to our families, his family don't always acknowledge it so it makes it harder for him to talk to his parents about it, which makes sense. things seemed to be going really well and i was the happiest i've ever been, we didnt spend much time together in 2025, his grandma was taken to hospital early on in the year and ended up passing away, this was the first time his really dealt with grieve and was super close to his grandparents so i know this time was difficult for him so i gave him all the time and space he wanted, i would always check in just so he knew i was there if he needed me but i tried not to be too needy. we never slept together during our time together, i think getting past the friends and co-workers thing was a little difficult for him as i certainly shown interest but was not something i needed to rush as we were enjoying getting to know eachother on a much deeper level. we did hook up on valentines day, and thats the last time i got to spend any time with him 1-on-1 so a part of me feels like that might have contributed to him ending things, even though he claims it wasn't. he ended things with me in march via a text saying that where he was in life he just didn't have the time or energy to put into a relationship and he felt it wasnt fair for me or him. (i knew he wouldnt have been able to do it in person knowing him, so as much as it hurt me him doing it via text, i do understand it) things were really hard at first as i obviously had to still work him with, we went from being really close friends at work to partners and i was always a little tactile with him at work so was hard to turn that off. everyone we work with still thinks we are together because we still kinda act like we are and i also dont feel like its anyones business to know we aren't. fast foward a few months, end of may i asked him out again, he said things were just different and i asked him not to answer but to think about it properly and we'd talk about it soon. he admited that he missed me sometimes and he still really cared about me but things were just different, but he agreed to take time to think about everything we spoke about. i asked him for a kiss which he leaned in for, and then over the last month every time i've seen him, will always kiss him goodbye or ask for a cheeky kiss and he would always kiss me back. i am very aware that i was the one always initiating this but he also never pulled away or rejected me. this went on for a month as everytime i tried to talk to him about me and him he would avoid the situation and i suppose to some degree i was avoiding it too because i knew once we talked me kissing him would stop again and it's been nice being tactile with him again. when we spoke last week he said he still has a lot going on (i know quite a lot about the stuff going on with his family) but he said he also has stuff himself he needs to sort out. i told him there wasn't a single thing he could say that would make me change my feelings for him and that i still loved him, and that i'll always look out for him. we haven't spoken for a week as ive been off work, and kinda dreading going back to work as i'll have to see him which im looking foward too but also know it will be quite difficult as i am unable to turn my feelings off, there's still so much i want to ask him. but mainly, i just want to know why it ended. he said i was one of the nicest guys he has ever met and that obviously he still cares a lot about me, but i don't know what to do moving foward. my biggest fear is that he will quit and then i'd never see him again. sorry for long post, thought maybe getting some of this down might help.... would love to know if anyone has ever navigated through something similar...",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,4.0,0.0037174721189591076,0.0018587360594795538,0.09200743494423792,1.0,0.0

"pleaseee help me see what went wrong!!! i’m desperate. ok so i never thought id post on this subreddit but here i am lol, almost 3 weeks ago my bf of almost a year broke up w me over a google meet and i never saw it coming 😭😭 if anyone is willing to read all of this and help me understand what’s going on, i would be beyond thankful. here is some context - he basically wanted me for a year before we got together but i rejected him, then later on during the summer before our hs senior year we got together. our relationship was pretty much perfect for the first few months, we both have v similar interests so we literally led school clubs together and shared our classes. we are both pretty academically driven so it got competitive sometimes. i always did slightly better than him and while he’d tell me he’s proud of me/call me smart, i could tell it made him insecure. he said how he had imposter syndrome and never be proud of his achievements even tho i constantly told him how proud of him i was. so we’d get into arguments abt that sometimes, id help him a lot w his feelings about school but it got to a point where i told him it was ridiculous how he’d constantly put himself down and act like he’s failing when in reality he had one of the highest grades in our graduating class. i was still always there for him tho. that was one of our main issues, him being extremely insecure and comparing us. another thing we’d argue over a lot is politics (he’s a trump supporter, i despise trump) but we accepted that it’s ok to have diff political beliefs and it didn’t change the way we thought of each other, although it got frustrating at times. then there were arguments here and there abt personality differences, im a very emotional, expressive person and while he can be expressive too, he was more laid back and “nonchalant” during the relationship, ofc he still showed me love and always asked to see me/bought things for me but there were times where i would ask him to put in more effort when it came to showing affection and stuff like that. he understood and tried to change but that is just a personality thing he had which i also tried to accept. but arguments like that are normal and every time we always made up and acknowledged our faults and made things better. they became quite frequent at times but we would both talk things out and apologize and say we’d never want to leave each other. a month before our breakup, he told me that he had a porn addiction that he finally got over. he said he’s had it since a very young age and didn’t know how to tell me until he “prayed it away”, went to church, etc. i was obv quite devastated and reacted badly, and contemplated the relationship. it changed the way i viewed myself for a while and he knew that and wrote me paragraphs about how much he loves me and loves the way i look and he was sorry for lusting but he wants to marry me (and no sex before marriage), etc. i did admire that he had the courage to tell me abt his addiction, even tho he told me way too late into the relationship and told me during our final exams period 😭 i told him i forgive him, although it was evident that it negatively affected my perception of my body for a while after that. he did help me through it tho. after that, i would lash out at him more often bc i subconsciously tied everything to his addiction. not replying to me? maybe he’s watching porn (when he’s just playing video games). doesn’t put in enough effort? maybe it’s bc i don’t look like those girls (but he’d constantly tell me im the most beautiful woman and he didn’t care about the girls, only about watching the “act”). i talked to him abt the reason why i’ve been more emotional recently and apologized, and i said over time im trying to get over it. he understood me, we hugged it out and he told me it’s all gonna be ok, this was around a week before he left me. now before he left me - we are both intl students living in an expat country. we applied to the same unis so we could go together, but he always told me that if we went long distance, he’d never leave me. we both got into the uni he is going to in his home country and he begged me to go w him. i chose to go there and even paid the deposit. for a month, we thought we were gonna go together and we were rlly excited. however, my parents and i realized last minute that it’ll be way too expensive for me since im an intl student there (he pays domestic fees) and id be in a ton of debt after my degree. i’m already a citizen of a first world country with great education, so it was a no brainer for me to just complete my undergrad degree there which is much more affordable. i only planned to go to his country to be w him, and our countries are on opposite sides of the world. i had to break that news to him a week before we broke up, but he was constantly reassuring me and being v supportive. i cried to him abt how much id miss him and he told me he loves me sm and that “if we ever break up it wont be bc of distance”. 4 days before leaving me, he took me out and bought me stuff and comforted me and kept telling me its gonna be ok. the next day, he suddenly went all cold and asked to call me. on the call he started talking abt how he doesn’t know if he can put in the effort during long distance, he said he’s worried, he even went into “cultural/religious differences” between us (we’re only diff denominations of christianity, i don’t see the issue). i got worried and told him we can work it out, we would literally be apart for max 2-3 years (and i can still visit him multiple times a year) and then we could do our postgrad together. i could also do study abroad in his uni. i told him i loved him, for the first time ever he didn’t say it back. he continued to not say it back and i got rlly scared. he then told me he needs space to think abt everything and didn’t want to give me “false hope”. he took around 3 days, the night he said he needed space i almost had a panic attack at around 2am bc i was rlly scared. i didn’t know what else to do so i just called him. he picked up and he helped me breathe. he said “im here with you tonight” which worried me bc he made it seem like he wasn’t gonna be there for me after that. i cried and told him i need him and said i dont want to break up. told him i loved him, he still didn’t say it back. asked him if im still his gf, he didn’t respond. he told me he’s overwhelmed and it wasn’t fair for me to do this when he needed space, and he’ll talk to me soon. he hung up after he “heard that i was breathing better” while i was still saying his name trying to talk to him. i get he needed space, but i was so fucking worried about him leaving and wanted him to know how much i care for him and im willing to make anything work. i sent him messages on every social media i had him, telling him that whatever concerns he had abt us, we can sit down and talk it out. i sent photos of us telling him how cute we are and i never want to let that go. kept telling him i love him. this was all the next day. after sending all these messages, i realized i should stop and give him time. the day after, i started to get concerned bc we have never gone that long without talking before. i ended up writing him a 5,500 word email, attached photos of us, addressing everything. i named the subject “when you’re ready, please read this” and emphasized in the beginning that he doesn’t have to read it straight away bc i knew he wanted space. i then addressed everything to him, how we could make the distance work, how i can do study abroad w him, how i can still visit him throughout the year, how we are doing postgrad together. i told him i was willing to spend the money to see him and i was willing to sacrifice my sleep for him even if it meant he didn’t. i addressed the “religious differences” even said im willing to raise our children as the same denomination as him (that’s what he wanted). i apologized for being emotional/dramatic a lot and said “i’ll change” and we can sit down and discuss his concerns. i went into detail about absolutely everything and gave multiple realistic solutions, 5.5k words is not a joke. i sent the email. he messaged me the day after saying he’s ready to talk and wants to on a google meet. he said he read the email and he acknowledged all the messages i wrote to him on every app, saying he read it fully. he told me he read my email multiple times. we go on the call and i’m panicking, he starts by saying he doesn’t think we’re compatible and the relationship isn’t gonna work out. he talked about long distance, how he’s worried i put in more effort than he does. he even went on about cultural values which made no sense. he said it’s a problem w him and not w me. he said he doesn’t see flaws in me, but in himself. i told him that wasn’t true and just blamed myself for everything so he could stay w me. he said he can’t “emotionally” be there for me and he can’t handle the responsibilities of being in a relationship. he said he wants to just focus on uni. i was crying and basically hyperventilating to him, gave him all these solutions and kept emphasizing the email. he said nothing can change his mind and said “goodbye” and just left while i was crying. before he left i told him im gonna go to his house and talk it out (we literally live 7 mins away so idk why he did this over call) and he said i can’t. after he left, he sent me a text saying i can’t go to his house as im “crossing a boundary” and said there “shouldn’t be bad blood between us”. he then proceeded to block me on every single app. he even used ai to photoshop me out of his insta pfp before changing it to a photo i took of him. i was so confused, i was so hurt and so angry. despite everything i did, he ended it just like that. i reached out to his friends (who are also my friends) and asked if they knew anything, they tried communicating w him. i left most of the stuff he gave me in a bag in his garage (and made sure to include the photos we took 4 days prior as well as the love letter he wrote me on my birthday) and he found it shortly after. he then reached out to me a week later, said he heard “rumors”, i lashed out at him and he wrote paragraphs about how he’s sorry how things ended and i didn’t deserve it. he apologized for doing it on call, for not communicating w me earlier, for the reassurance i got 4 days prior, for the photoshop. he tried to give me “closure” over text but i demanded we meet irl so i can say my side too and he agreed. we met a couple weeks ago, i had a note on my phone w stuff i wanted to say to him. again, he kept emphasizing how his two main reasons were long distance (which i questioned bc he told me he’d never leave me over that, but he said his “doubts grew” and he didn’t want smth to happen to us when we were apart), and me putting in more effort, which made him feel “guilty” and that he didn’t deserve me. i told him i only wanted him and he took that in. he said he blocked me bc he’s “never been in a breakup and thought that’s what you do”. said he’s on some “religious journey” and said he doesn’t want to date at all. i kept calling him out on everything and he ended up apologizing profusely, he eventually got emotional and called himself a “horrible person” and said he “threw it all away”. he apologized for being a bad communicator. he genuinely seemed sincere. he had to leave before i could finish telling him what i wanted to say (i still have a lot left) bc his dad called him. he told me he’d unblock me everywhere and meet with me again to finish the conversation. he kept apologizing and said he’ll see me again. however, it’s been almost 2 weeks. i still haven’t been unblocked. he requested to follow me on insta 2 days after for a split second but then blocked me again. still heard nothing about meeting me again. he avoided discussing the topic w my friend and said he wants to “move on” but that’s unfair bc he lied to me. i heard he’s posting love songs and songs that i told him about in his insta notes. he’s still communicating w me on this gc that we have for a former school club bc we’re working on something, keeping it “professional” but it is driving me insane how he’s trying to act nice w me when im literally blocked on the app that gc is on. i’m sorry i wrote a lot. thank you to whoever made it to the end. i really want to finish the convo and get closure but i think he just doesn’t know what he wants rn and wants to avoid accountability. has anyone been in a similar situation? do u know the cause/what exactly is going on? i wake up everyday and feel so empty and i just want to stop feeling this way. i miss him, and i still love him. i showed him my love even while he was breaking up w me. he showed me so much affection until literally 4 days before he left me. only 2 weeks prior was his birthday party where we were so in love and i spent a lot of money on. i fucking hate what he did to me and i never ever expected it from him. now at the very least, i want what he promised me, to finish our conversation and to be unblocked. but it’s been two weeks. i’m still blocked. how can i go about this and does anyone have any idea about what he might be going through/what he’s

"am i really moving on? or am i just coping with uncertainty?… my partner broke up with me on the 5th of june. it was sudden for me. we’d had a relationship going strong for 6 months after repairing a failed 3 month relationship mid way through last year. i’ve had my time to grieve, reconviene over text and talk with him, and he told me that he just didn’t have romantic feelings for me, but he does love me, it’s just platonic for him, which in itself i struggle to understand, especially after breaking up the first time because he had lost feelings, and then vowing to start a new relationship 3 months later where we’d share open honest communication throughout because he felt like even being friends still made him feel like something was missing between us. when me and him texted after we broke up this time around, i asked him if his platonic love meant he valued me as a friend, but he said he didn’t know what i meant when i asked that. not once throughout our chats did he mention that he wanted to be friends with me, only that he wanted me in his life, he didn’t want to loose me, and that he was willing to recieve anything i was willing to offer him when it came to talking again in the future. we haven’t spoken at all in two weeks now. but we ended our conversation with me telling him i needed time, and maybe we’d be able to talk at some point when uni starts, since unfortunately we are going to the same uni. he told me that he’d be happy to give me the time, and “maybe when uni starts we can start to try out a new relationship between the two of us”. given the context of what’s happened between us, “relationship” is a very confusing word, and when i’ve spoken to friends about it, i’ve had mixed responses saying “he could just mean a friendship” while others assume he plans to jump into another relationship with me in the future. i reside with both arguments to what he means by that, but given the fact that we’ve stepped away before and reconviened to start a new relationship it makes me wonder if that’s what he expects to happen again. if he meant a friendship, then why wouldn’t he just say “start to try a friendship between the two of us”? nonetheless, i’ve been trying to not let that get to me, i’ve started trying to move on, deleting our chats, removing photos of us from my phone. i’ve stopped venting so much to friends about him because i know that it gets to a point where they don’t want to hear about it anymore because it’s not like they can fix anything permenantly with a few words of comfort. i’d say overall i’m progressing quite nicely, but every now and then when i’m alone, or after i’ve had a long day, i miss him that little bit more, and that empty feeling comes flooding back in. i miss when missing him wasn’t a bad thing, and he was just a message away. i miss hearing his name and thinking “oh my gosh someone’s just mentioned my person”. i miss how much i loved learning to understand him and his quirks, i miss the feeling that no matter how much changes in my life, i sat comfortably with the idea that there was someone who would always be there for me. i miss looking forward to seeing him, i miss the way he treated me, sent me posts out of no-where expressing his love for me, his little random texts telling me he loved me. i miss the first time he said i love you, i miss all the times i felt safe with him. i just miss someone who i thought was my person. my partner. it makes me cringe to even consider him an “ex”. i know if we do start talking again when uni starts in a few months time, there’s potential that we could end up going through the same cycle again. i am cautious of that which is why i’m trying to move on and remove the hope that comes with talking again in september. but god i just miss him. i’ve seen videos telling me that “i don’t miss him, i miss the feeling of being with him” but it’s all crap. i’m trying to move on but i can’t help but miss everything about him, and us, and the way he treated me. i genuinely think about him every day, wether that thought be big or small, he’s still there. am i really trying to move on? because some days it just feels like i’m coping with the uncertainty that could become of us talking again in the future.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,5.0,0.005868544600938967,0.01056338028169014,0.11854460093896714,4.0,0.0
"should i break up with him after 4 years? god, it feels so alien to type this out. i’ve been with my boyfriend for 4 years, he’s been by best friend and confidante. i love him unconditionally, but the issue between us has always been how avoidant he is with hard emotional topics. he has childhood trauma, and maybe this is why i still have so much empathy towards him and excuse his actions towards me. he was never taught how to love someone, or trust someone with his emotions or fears. in no means is he a bad person, but a deeply flawed man. i’ve begged multiple times to just walk by his side, to let me in not to give him solutions but a shoulder to lean on. we’ve had a lot of issues with this, also with how cold he comes off over text or putting effort to be interested in my passions, hobbies, studies like i’ve always tried to with him. all arguments we’ve had, i’ve begged him to just listen to me, but he always avoids accountability and deflects or switches the topic completely. he’s knowingly left me spiraling and crying the whole night while he slept. tonight he actually did tell me what’s been going on in his mind, after i had to force him to be honest with me. because usually he says he’s okay but i know he’s not so i try to comfort him or investigate. he told me he regrets making promises he couldn’t keep, when he had talked about marriage. he told me a lot of things are stressing him out, and i cause him the most stress with expectations. and it all just hit hard to the point i couldn’t reply, his last words were calling himself a coward. i don’t want to blame him… but i mourn the girl i was just before i met him. i isolated myself from friendships, and neglected my studies during these past 4 years. i truly feel like my entire world is falling apart. and what sucks the most… is i want him to fight for me. i’ve begged him to. and he never has, even until now. i feel like irreparable damage has been made… because i don’t know if i overreacted or demanded too much, even when standing up for myself on the bare minimum of love. maybe i already know the answer to my own question, but there are moments of hope. and the pandora’s box of all our memories from the past four years that force me to keep fighting… i just wish he’d do the same for me. i feel worthless, and that maybe the kind of love i wish i could feel reciprocated doesn’t exist…",breakup,1,2383.0,476.0,3.0,0.0063025210084033615,0.012605042016806723,0.10084033613445378,1.0,0.0

"dealing with regret a few months ago, i made a decision that i still wrestle with: i ended a relationship with someone i truly loved. at the time, i was overwhelmed by internal conflict i was trying to be present for my child and the mother of my child, while still carrying emotional ties to the woman i’d fallen in love with. i chose what felt like stability over what felt like emotional alignment. and when i tried to go back to rebuild the relationship i left, it was too late she’d been hurt and had begun to move on. i respected her boundaries and didn’t try to manipulate the situation. i’ve taken full responsibility for the pain my indecision caused her, and i’ve tried to grow from it. we reconnected recently before she left for another country, and there were kind words, shared laughter, even soft moments. she said she misses me. she also reminded me that we’re over. i’ve been stuck between acceptance and hope. i’ve done everything i can to heal therapy, journaling, applying for work, staying grounded. i’m proud of how i’ve shown up lately, but the truth is… i still miss her. i still love her. i still wonder if the door will open again. but i also know i need to keep walking, even if it doesn’t. would love to hear how others have dealt with the weight of regret, the hope for reconnection, and the process of becoming whole again even when the ending wasn’t what you wanted.",breakup,1,1397.0,267.0,2.0,0.00749063670411985,0.018726591760299626,0.11235955056179775,0.0,0.0

"he’s leaving for a mission, and i’m left picking up the pieces hey reddit, a month ago, i went through my first real breakup. he's not dating anyone else—he said we were breaking up because he's going on an lds mission. but the stupid thing is… he hasn't even left. he hasn't even put in his papers. he doesn't know when he's leaving, or where he's going. it felt like the idea of a mission was more real to him than our relationship ever was. looking back, i think the *real* reason we broke up is that i told him i wouldn't wait for him while he was away. i'm 16. two years is a long time, and i told him honestly that i wouldn't be putting my life on hold. i think that's what triggered the breakup more than anything. he needed someone who'd pause their entire world for him, and i wasn't going to do that. but we still snapped after. he kept sending heart emojis and compliments, and i let myself hope. i thought maybe he still cared—perhaps we weren't over. so i told him i still loved him. and i asked if he wanted to try again. he said i was a distraction. and that i should use this breakup to become a better person. that shattered me. he was the one sending mixed signals. he was the one who wouldn't give me what i needed emotionally *while we were together.* and now i was the ""distraction""? it hurt. it made me feel like i was crazy for caring, for hoping, for being honest. i have anxious attachment, and i told him that early on. i told him what helped, what i needed, and he said he'd try—but nothing changed. i asked for simple things, like flowers, and consistent texts, and he never followed through. i think i held onto a fantasy more than the reality. that's on me, but it still hurts. our relationship was only two months, but i still can't move on, and it's been a month. i still see him all the time because we share things with each other's family, and it's become hard. since then, i've tried to move on. i've done silly pick-up lines and tried being bold. pretended i was fine. but a lot of that was just me trying to rebuild the self-worth i lost. sometimes i still miss him. sometimes i feel phantom kisses. but i'm starting to realize i'm not broken—i'm just healing. it's stupid, but i still keep thinking maybe if i had done something different, we would still be together. i've been doing a lot of thinking. about why i cared so much. about what kind of love i really want. about how even now, i still catch myself comparing new people to him, even though i know i shouldn't. your first relationship really does leave a lasting impression on you. and here's the thing—i don't even know how to start dating again. how to flirt without faking confidence. how to stop feeling like i'm too much or not enough. i want someone new, but i don't want to lose myself in the process of finding it. so if you've been through something like this—especially your first love falling apart—please tell me i'm not insane. or just let me know i'm not alone in this mess. thanks for reading.

"how to end long distance relationship? i'm in a long-distance relationship with a woman i met online earlier this year, and we met in person in her country back in march. the more i’ve gotten to know her, the more i’ve realised i don’t feel the spark i hoped for. i’m at a point now where i just don’t know how to end things especially because it would come as a complete shock to her and impact her mental health. she’ll ask why, and i don’t have a dramatic reason, or any reason except that i don't feel that spark. she hasn’t done anything wrong. i just don’t feel that connection, and i know there’s **nothing** she could change about herself nor would i want her to. brief background about her: i’m her first **serious** boyfriend (she is 29), and she’s told me many times how much she loves me and how she can’t imagine life without me. she says she can't live without me. honestly, i wouldn’t be surprised if she said she’d take a bullet for me. she is living with some of her sisters in a studio apartment in an expensive city, while she finishes her studies in about a year. her sisters can be controlling or/and insensitive. she is conscious about being nearly 30, understandably. before we met, she struggled badly with her mental health because of her living situation with her sisters and being physically and mentally abused (nothing sexually) by her family. since we started talking, and with the support and love i have given her, she’s said her mental health has improved a lot and i can actually see the improvement. however, she has said that she would rather die than live in her country permanently. she has repeated that several times on several different occasions. when i met her in her country, i promised her a trip to visit me as a tourist in my country and to introduce her to my family within a couple of months. but because of a major staffing shake up at work (beyond my control) *during* my holiday, i wasn’t able to bring her when i said i would. she was devastated and doubted my intentions, but after i explained that there was no point in her visiting while i was stuck at work—and her family backed that up and she finally understood. still, the doubt lingered in her head, understandably. since then, she’s been **begging** me to get her out of her country **asap**. i told her early on in the relationship that **if** we were still together after two years, i’d apply for a partner visa so she could come live with me permanently - and that's **absolutely** true. it's 2 years minimum for a partner visa in my country. from day one, she’s been planning her whole life around that with me - talking about kids, homes, career, and building a future together in my country as she is approaching her 30s. i’ve helped her financially by helping her with her tuition fees, living expenses, and small inexpensive gifts. no one has ever been that kind to her and not asked for anything in return. she always posts about them on facebook and tells her family about these things. i’ve met some of her family (they even gave me some souvenirs when i met them), and she constantly talks about me to them, saying how well i treat her. yesterday, i brought up a potential source of passive income she hadn’t properly pursued yet (nothing megabucks). but the conversation took a difficult turn. she reacted emotionally, sharing how overwhelmed she felt by the constant pressure from her family and now from me as well. the weight of her situation in her home country is not just finances; she is grappling with deeper emotional strains and a sense of entrapment. her hope, as she had shared with me before, is to find a man that is emotionally and financially stable and kind who could help her build a better life elsewhere. although **i do absolutely care** for her and have the means to support such a transition, i have found myself confronting an uncomfortable truth: the depth of emotional love needed to make that kind of sacrifice was no longer there. had i still been in love, i would still continue supporting her. rather than just breaking up with her ""out of the blue"" for a ""random reason"", would it be fairer to just say i’m not in a position to support her financially the way she wants and deserves? this avoids going into the ""whys"" of not loving her? her birthday is coming up in a month and i feel shit for doing it so soon before that. then she has a new dream job starting around the same time, and i don't want her to mess that up because of me. a week or two for her to get over the initial shock is better than doing it when she starts her new job. i know there’s no perfect way to break this off and whatever i say, it’s going to shatter her dreams. she’ll be embarrassed in front of her friends and family. she will say i wasted her time, i was never serious (**not** true). and most of all, i’m worried about how it will impact her mental health. if anyone has suggestions on how to end this with care, i would really appreciate it. i know not to argue with her and play the blame game. she can accuse me of anything (even if not true), and i won't be upset. thank you.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,5.0,0.005154639175257732,0.013402061855670102,0.0731958762886598,3.0,0.0

"he’s moving on. please help me. i was with my high school sweetheart for 10 years when we finally broke up, including a failed engagement. the relationship was toxic, abusive. he was an alcoholic and i ended up cheating. it is far more nuanced than that summary can ever convey but please believe me when i say that we both are very different people now. we are now just two months shy of two years broken up. neither of us have dated. i’ve been on dating apps since the breakup, he joined dating apps in april. he remained in the town we lived and kept our friends, i moved home and lost everything. i know i seem like the bad guy and though i wasn’t innocent, there was equal blame to be shared. i begged for him back for the first year of our breakup. he was not having it- often berating me and requesting no contact. then, in the summer, he wanted to get back together right when i started feeling okay finally. we saw each other a few times but nothing ever happened. over the past year, we’ve been toying with the idea of getting back together but i’ve said i need more time. he is a different person than he was when we dated but by the end, i was scared of him and didn’t know if i could jump back in. fast forward to him being the best version of himself he’s ever been - a version i begged for at least 6 years - and he’s seeing someone new. after just two months on the apps. he’s “taking it serious”. i am wrecked. i am so angry and upset that a new girl gets the best version of him and i wasted ten years of my life with someone who ended up resenting me. she’s 24, the age that i was when we broke up, and i’m just so mad that she gets a clean slate with this version of him. “i’m a wreck” is an understatement. i knew that i had feelings still but i am out of my mind. i want to jump out of my skin. i can’t do this. i don’t want him to be dating someone new. there’s so much more but i just am so frazzled. i am so broken. this is literal hell on earth.",breakup,1,1971.0,407.0,7.5,0.019656019656019656,-0.007371007371007371,0.11793611793611794,0.0,0.0
i don’t know if i’m really understanding the breakup so my girlfriend and i recently (within the week) just broke up she broke up with me and i didn’t want to cause i felt like that we probably could be fixed it but she disagreed so now i’ve found myself sad but like it doesn’t feel like we have even broken up like i know we have and i still get that heavy feeling in my chest it hurts to fall asleep and sucks to wake up. but i feel like i haven’t let myself truly feel the breakup. i think i’m comparing this to my breakups before this when i was completely torn apart and like not functioning. so maybe i’m just handling this one much better. because i know how to not handle it like before i would go days without sleeping or eating and all i could do was pretty much lay in bed and cry. this time around ive been going to the gym everyday hanging out with my friends and playing video games. and even when i am alone i have my moments where i’m upset but i just don’t feel destroyed all the time like beforei still think about her and all of that but it just almost literally doesn’t feel real even though it’s very real i honestly don’t know i know we are broken up and i am sad about this but i just feel like i haven’t fully registered like i probably will never see her again and that it’s over and i need to move on. so my question is am i letting myself feel the breakup or am i just pushing my feelings back and i will feel it later which i don’t want id rather deal with it right now. any tips or advice would be appreciated,breakup,1,1539.0,325.0,7.0,0.021538461538461538,-0.009230769230769232,0.13538461538461538,0.0,0.0

"i don’t know how to fully let go i (f, early 20s) recently cut things off with someone i loved deeply, my best friend (m, same age). we were incredibly close. i was his safe space, and he was mine. we shared everything. he used to say, “you’re the only person i’ve ever been this real with.” we were on the phone every night. he’d get vulnerable when tired, flirt with me like it meant something, talk about the future sometimes… it felt like we were already something, just unnamed. but it was always murky. there were days he’d open up completely, and days he’d pull away like he was afraid of being seen. i now realize, he’s likely avoidant. deeply avoidant. he grew up with his own emotional baggage, and while he cared, he was terrified of intimacy. he’d make me feel wanted one second, then disappear emotionally the next. it was a constant loop of closeness and distance. i never knew where i stood. after months of this, i finally confessed. i told him how i felt. he didn’t say no. in fact, he said he’d felt the same for a long time, but didn’t want to confess cause he knew it would never work out. in fact, i noticed him withdrawing at times and would spiral thinking it’s my fault but he later admitted to pulling away so he wouldn’t get too attached and when i asked him why he didn’t completely he said it’s cause he wanted me too and missed me too much. he then asked for time, came back we spent three days where he told me we should try but then would change his mind but wasn’t fully ready to let me go and block him either. he even told me he couldn’t stop thinking about this, couldn’t work, couldn’t gym, his heart rate was high ever since i told him and i could hear how shocked and shaken he was in his voice. i gave him a day to fully decide and he came back and said he was conflicted maybe not ready. but then he even told me it would be the same as what we were already doing for the past two months(in a relationship but just without the label) and said we should try and then dropped a bomb: he’d just filed for his green card, and legally couldn’t leave the u.s. for the next five years. he asked, “can we survive long-distance for that long, without even seeing each other?” and when i hesitated, when i panicked, he said, “then maybe we shouldn’t try.” as if that was it. so i told him i needed to block him to move on, we both cried but he didn’t stop me this time and i did block him, for two hours during which i practically bawled my eyes out. i broke down, unblocked him. i begged him to stay, told him i couldn’t handle this ending without trying. he agreed, saying 5 years is maybe too far and we’re overthinking “okay, let’s try long-distance.” i told him and asked him multiple times that let’s no because he isn’t ready and what if he was just saying yes because w i was crying. he reassured me, told me he wanted it, told me he was dating to marry me. i also voiced my concerns about him pulling back and distancing randomly and he told me he’s not leaving, he’s right here and got me through my whole panic attack and told me to go rest after that. but after the moment he agreed… he emotionally disappeared. he didn’t text to check on me. he didn’t act like someone who had just entered a relationship. he just… vanished emotionally. again. and i had kind of expected this because even when he agreed i didn’t feel happy or relief only dread, waiting for the other shoe to drop and was left doubting everything. did he say yes because i was crying? was he guilted into it? was i forcing him to stay? he was breadcrumbing me. watching my stories. messaging my best friend to ask if i’m okay. but not talking to me. not showing up for me. not choosing me. he even told my best friend he’s worried i’m just a rebound for him, even though he’s the one who kept initiating intimacy for months. he flirted, confided, teased, and relied on me emotionally, but when it came time to step up, he just didn’t. i feel used, confused, and discarded. and still, i miss him. i miss my best friend. i miss the person i thought he was, or maybe just the person i was with him. i’ve always struggled with anxious attachment, and this entire situation has triggered my worst fears: of not being enough, of being too much, of being abandoned. i’ve had panic attacks. i’ve cried until i couldn’t breathe. i wake up in the middle of the night with a pit in my stomach and dreams where he’s choosing not to be with me all over again. i’ve had to try meds but they don’t work but i think i’m getting better on my own, crying and letting it all out. everyone tells me: “you didn’t lose someone who loved you. you lost someone who couldn’t love you the way you deserve.” but it doesn’t make it hurt less. i want to move on. i want to forget him. but i feel like my body is still waiting. still hoping he’ll say: “i messed up. i want you.” even though i know that’s not fair to either of us. if you’ve ever loved someone who never fully chose you, who kept you close but never close enough, how did you let go?",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,6.0,0.0058823529411764705,0.00392156862745098,0.10294117647058823,5.0,0.0

"my ex girlfriend of 8 years is pregnant (not mine) my ex-girlfriend (same age, 35) and i were together for 8 years. we officially broke up at the end of september. we’ve only spoken once since then, and that was in december—just to clear the air and make sure there was no hate between us. she didn’t say much; i did most of the talking. since then, it’s been no contact. fast forward to yesterday—she announced on instagram that she’s 3 months pregnant. i don’t have social media, but i had to go look after people asked me about it. she didn’t post who the father is, so a couple of people reached out to ask if i was the dad.. so people asking that stung a little. i’ve been feeling a bunch of emotions because we always talked about having a family someday, and now, not even a year after our breakup, she’s starting one with someone else. this whole thing is odd because this time last year we were in puerto rico. heck she even posted a picture i took of her there 3 days prior to her announcement. i did call her and sent a congratulations text, but she didn’t respond—and i get why. still, i’m feeling jealous that she was able to move on so fast, while i’m still stuck in this limbo. in a way, it’s a good thing—it gives me closure. i can finally close the door on the idea of us getting back together. but i’m also a little angry that i got wrapped up in this drama. people are contacting me, and it all could’ve been avoided if she had just posted the father. i’m currently in therapy. it’s been weird lately. i’m not depressed anymore, but i’m not really happy either. i’m in this middle ground. it’s nice, but odd. i feel like i should be happy, but i’m just kind of numb—just existing. i’m just glad i’m not as sad anymore. sorry—i know i’m just rambling and ranting at this point. i figured i’d scream this into the void and get it off my chest",breakup,1,1859.0,382.0,7.0,0.01832460732984293,0.005235602094240838,0.10732984293193717,0.0,0.0

"never been so down in my life me (24m) and my ex (21f) broke up recently after a really toxic year-long relationship—both of us played a part in that. when we first got together, things were amazing. she was utterly obsessed with me, and i was really into her—especially physically (actually we both were, i think we were both equally physically attracted to each other so was a bit of a jackpot), i thought she was absolutely stunning, and i think that’s a big reason i’m struggling to let go, i know it seems shallow but it’s true. early on, i asked about her past (i’m a bit old-fashioned that way), and she gave me a number and even swore on her mum’s life (which may seem silly but actually meant something to me). later, i found out in a horrible way she’d lied. it wasn’t the number that hurt—it was the broken trust, she cried and begged me not to leave so i stayed because i loved her. after that, things got rocky. we argued constantly, and she lied about smaller things too which added to the hurt. she was incredibly caring in other ways, but arguments would turn her into someone else. i also wasn’t perfect—i didn’t always communicate or respect her right, and i truly regret that. eventually, she ended things and it was the genuine breakup from hell. almost immediately, she started seeing this guy she’d been seeing during our past breakup but left him and blocked him for me when we got back together. i know she probably feels justified how fast she got with someone because of how bad things got between us and her hatred for me now. i’m stuck now wondering—was i too harsh? should i have stayed and pushed through? i miss her constantly, even knowing how messy it all was.",breakup,1,1693.0,328.0,7.0,0.021341463414634148,-0.006097560975609756,0.10975609756097561,2.0,0.0

"is this normal? over the course of my (28f) relationship of almost 4 years with my ex (28m) i have emotionally checked out. there were some red flags i kept ignoring because he was always a bit ""weird"" as people described him and i was convinced he is a bit autistic, or at least an introvert or something neurodivergent idk. anyway, a few months prior to our breakup i started avoiding intimacy and wasnt excited about going out together or anything anymore. this made me feel incredibly guilty, especially since i couldnt wrap my mind around the fact that i cant even try anymore to feel something. especially since it was time to plan our housing, we got steady jobs finally and potentially marriage and kids and so on.... i talked with him about how i feel. he dismissed it at first, then i said i should at least get my mind clear and i started going to therapy praying my therapist would just say im afraid of conmitment or that i am anxious and anxiety is spilling all over my relationship and potential changes. ofc, the therapist said nothing. then i wanted to seperate, move out. he still didnt believe me until the day i said i have found a new place to stay, and then he wanted to talk about all of it, he listened to me and wanted me to stay, to give it one more try. i explained, honestly, that i have lost feelings and its been bothering me for quite some time. and i was hoping therapy would help me find out the reason for that. i told him im usually anxious, so it could be just fear of changes or it could be that i hold some resentment because of how rude he was to some of my friends and sister and how we never really resolve our fights because of his pettiness. whatever the reason, i couldnt bring myself to feel again and that we shouldnt stay together since it would just be wasting even more time. he should find someone who wont overthink the whole relationship for so long like i did. he thinks he is not a petty person and that i love him, that im just scared of commitment. he started saying that to all our friends when i moved out and when some of them wouldnt agree, he would insult them.we broke up with me saying i dont love him anymore and him saying im wrong and that he knows me better than i do myself, and its all just anxiety, that he would like to be friends and also smthng like a therapist to me whenever i want. i cut off contact because it was all overwhelming all of a sudden but a week after he contacted me as a friend and asked for cup of coffee, when i refused, he told me i should just block his number since i have no intention of hanging out or talking. i refused because i thought he is just saying that out of spite and because he is hurting, but he insisted saying it would make things easier for him. so i blocked him. he started hanging out w our friends more and telling everyone how im a coward and so on, started drinking, took a sick leave on his work for some time. he started having some heated arguments w friends who refused to find out for him how im doing and it got to a point where those friends came to me to cry about how he treated them when they were just trying to be there for him. somehow, he also hacked my socials and found my diary from 5 years ago and my old photos and was spewing shit about me to everyone and making a case about who i actually am and how we r meant to be while also hating on me on some other occasions etc. some friends advised to get the restraining order or smthng, but i convinced them thats just how he deals with stuff that he is not dangerous. now, i know he is hurting. i was his first long term relationship, he was and prolly still is - grieving. but.. isnt all this behaviour just confirming that his red flags werent just him being inherently weird or is it normal to behave like this when youre hurting too much? im different and i cant understand this kind of behaviour, my sadness and my anger usually look aaalot different, im at my worst just self destructive, not an asshole. but i did hear about people having a horrible time doing horrible things after breakups and then after some time and healing, being completely different people. its been a year since then, i bumped into him recently and he still gives that vibe like he is going to smash some walls any second or burn the whole town. he loved me and i couldnt love him back and i couldnt accept him the way he is. the more i learned about him, the less i felt. i would never want to have kids w him and would never trust him to not snap in front of our kids and i honestly think he is immature. but he never treated me the way he treated our friends and my sister. im still failing to understand how he could be so golden to me and yet so snappy with others. after the breakup, the hell just broke loose. is this his real self or is he just grieveing??? is he just immature and will change or is he just an asshole?? does he have mental issues or just bad at coping w emotions??? its been really hard for me to tell which is which and the thought i ruined a good soul and stunted someones emotional growth is eating me inside. i feel the need to one more time try to tell him i do not love him and he should just let it go and stop torturing himself and everyone around him. he couldnt listen before cause he was hurting, but he would understand now?? friends tell me not to contact him in any way. i think theyre right. but im so anxious to the thought i might bump into him again and he just snaps at me or that he is gonna talk shit to some of my collegues as well just to get my attention. i would be at peace if i knew he is not going to come back at me somehow or do something insanely stupid or dangerous. please, advice. and sorry for so many words.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.008064516129032258,0.004480286738351254,0.0931899641577061,5.0,0.0
"should i even reclaim a hobby that now feel unsafe because of my ex? i am i guess what you would call anxiety attached but with probably a trauma component that i'm trying to figure out in therapy. i found a lot of joy in 2024 in playing tcgs. but end of last year i started dating a woman that pursued me and left her boyfriend for me, with both of them being part of the very small scene i am in. a lot of traumatic event followed, she was going back to him then to me then to him again and i took her back every time. he spread rumors, verbally assaulted me and threatened me when he found me at her house one afternoon, her and i had also had an abortion. and she was regularly very aggressive and disrespectful when i tried to put boundaries. so i finally got the courage, probably months too late, to cut all bridges with them, except i still want to play the hobby. i am on sick leave and feel a lot better, but the tcg space feels unsafe and contaminated. i lost a friend that is also part of the hobby and doesn't speak to me anymore because she was tired of me talking about the drama. now i've been dabbling into either subscribing to events where neither of them are (rare) or attend and feel miserable and anxious and leaving early most of the time. registering online and seeing their name can sometimes be enough for me to have an anxiety attack and start shaking. they went back together the day after i cut ties with her of course. should i completely give up the hobby, or fight for it? i made my peace with the relationship being over and mentally i know all i need to know but it seems my nervous system is traumatized and i don't know if i should prioritize safety or courage. thoughts?",breakup,1,1707.0,328.0,4.0,0.012195121951219513,0.0,0.0975609756097561,3.0,0.0

"ex randomly blocked me on instagram, but not whatsapp. why now? i’m 34 male, ex 33 female. messy break-up end of april while travelling together in the us for two months. 1 week from the end of our trip. she walked out on me after a horrible blazing row. i had reached the end of the tether with her self-centredness, bad attitude and lack of accountability. she was in perpetual victim mode and would never have a conversation if i dared express any frustration with her shitty behaviour. a few days went by at the end of travelling and she reached out over instagram and said she’s happy for me having a good time in my last week alone. i responded and she ignored me, i thought weird but whatever. nonetheless i wished her a safe flight home and she thanked me. got back to the uk she commented on a couple of my stories and again said she’s happy for me. mid may she gave me a call a few days later “checking in” only to then tell me a part of her misses and loves me but a part of her feels unsafe with me and she feels “traumatised” from my behaviour the last night. literally ridiculous she just couldn’t take accountability and resorted to crying and screaming like usual. perpetual victim who was having therapy for childhood trauma and doesn’t get on with half her family. i did know about the red flags and her entitled behaviour. she went onto say she doesn’t want to keep in contact after this call so i wondered, well why the fuck even call me then? one week went by and i messaged her just forwarding on some stuff contacts in the us sent me as i thought i should share. unsurprisingly no response. whatever then. one month since, i’ve been busy working and stopped looking at her insta stories and i barely post on there. she posted something the other day about being heartbroken after 7 weeks in america and now 7 weeks on feels in a good energy again. then weirdly this weekend i was thinking about her and was tempted to her ask her for some photos she took that i wanted for my blog, but i left it. then my mate called yesterday and randomly started asking me about her and if i’d heard from her or she blocked me and i said no to both. just no contact. then so weirdly after the call i found out she’d literally just blocked me last night! but just on instagram not whatsapp. and i’m just wondering, why? is she still after two months, mad with me? she said in our last call that she doesn’t hate me but i hate her. not true, i really don’t feel that strongly, i wish the best for her. but why this random block? is she trying to get a reaction, or is she just trying to move on and have some privacy? i find it a bit strange. she blocked me once before and unblocked me days later, but this is different for sure. she still talks (rarely) to both her previous exes (they live in different countries) and she always told me she likes to stay in contact with exes on good terms. of course we had a different relationship ending though as i called out her shitty behaviour a lot. she always said she liked that about me but turns out she couldn’t handle a guy who wasn’t a doormat like her exes. she must really hold a grudge and honestly we both taught each other a lot, i’d stay friends with her and let bygones be bygones but why reach out she’ll just ignore me anyway….",breakup,1,3293.0,641.0,7.5,0.0218408736349454,0.0093603744149766,0.09204368174726989,5.0,0.0
"quick question for everyone here so i’ve broken up with my ex for about a year and 7 months now. she dumped me because she thought i wasn’t gonna change but truth is i just was busy working full time and school full time trying to be an engineer. i listened to her but wasn’t consistent enough but she made it clear from the beginning health was priority. but i tried to be the perfect boyfriend. not just any boyfriend i was her emotional shield, career mentor, safe space, and day one supporter. i gave her my mind, my time, my energy, and my heart. she dumped me and then after 4 months she was with someone else. that’s fine. i go no contact for maybe 9-10 months. she calls me from a new number and we get to start talking. truth is i never really moved on from her i really loved her and thought maybe we could make it work. but she was still in a relationship so screw it she wanted to be friends and i made the mistake of being like cool. i made it clear i had feelings for her still but never went out my way to beg her or anything just played cool. we’ve known each other for 3 yrs and recently her daughter graduated from school and i wanted to celebrate it because i genuinely cared about the kid and when we were dating accepted her as my own. i asked her politely would it be okay with her if i brought flowers and a card for her kid just to put a smile on her and make her day. she said that’s fine. so i asked what time would it be okay i would just simply drop it off and and leave she said this weekend i gotta visit my dad. message me sunday. i message her again sunday night and she is like oh i’m actually not ny right now i’m outside of ny i appreciate you some bs. she wasn’t visiting her dad but was with her current man. my thing is first of all, you could have said you were gonna somewhere with your mans outside of ny i would have been fine with it. but to lie for no reason doesn’t make any sense. my intent wasn’t to find an opportunity to sneak back into your life, it was purely because i wanted to make child’s day. i know i’m dumb for even keeping contact with my ex but how many people experience pathological liars with their significant other?",breakup,1,2180.0,441.0,7.5,0.022675736961451247,0.0045351473922902496,0.10657596371882086,1.0,0.0
"she fell out of love my girlfriend and i of 2 and 1/2 years just broke up. she told me last night after a fairly successful conversation that she wanted to break up because she ""fell out of love,"" but she also said she still loves me in a different way. i don't really know what to make of this. for some months she has been treating me pretty poorly with a lot of ignoring me and invalidating how i felt about what she has done and just my feelings in general. she has been uncommunicative and distant and unapologetic and all that crap, while i feel i've been a pretty good partner. i have been working on codependency because, i mean, you can probably tell that i'm really codependent, but still i have been hiding it and being a good partner. i started to resent her, but i still love her and i'm really sad about breaking up. i don't know what to do with myself. again, she told me she fell out of love, but she still likes me. she said there isn't another person and i kinda asked her to reiterate that a few times. she apologized for how she has treated me and that stuff, but bleh. she also said we can be friends and we could play games sometime n stuff and i think i would like that. i don't know though, i don't know how i can just move on from this. a lot of her explanations for how she's felt are ""i don't know"" and ""it's complicated"" so it just sucks! it really sucks! i don't use reddit all that often, but i just really need to get my feelings out. thank you for reading edit: we are both evil women that were in an evil liberal agenda relationship or whatever lol... i wish i didnt feel this sorrowful like things we're my fault and i wish i could get over it. i feel pathetic and i wish i would stop crying over someone who hurt me repeatedly",breakup,1,1761.0,343.0,2.0,0.0058309037900874635,0.011661807580174927,0.119533527696793,0.0,0.0
"my ex doesn't think he's been toxic. so, here's a list i can use to remind myself that he was sometimes. 1. the first time he kissed me, i'd explicitly asked him not to kiss me. he argued that we'd been physically close in other ways and that it was unreasonable of me to expect him not to kiss me. i hadn't consented to it. he crossed and then argued about my very clear boundary. 2. he once said that gazans should just be absorbed into other arab countries and that the strip of land they were on wasn't worth anything anyway. it was just dirt and not valuable, totally denying that it's home for the people who live there. (for context, i'm middle eastern and he's white and both of us were raised in the u.s.) however you feel about the issue, the complete lack of empathy was shocking. 3. he broke up with me once last year because he thought that the reason why i'd had a falling out with a guy friend must have been because i'd dated him and we'd broken up. it wasn't. we'd had a fading away more than a falling out because he'd hinted at more and i hadn't wanted more. this was before my ex and i had even really started dating. i'd told him about it. 4. after we broke up, he sent a letter to my aunt (who he'd never met) because he thought i needed ""help."" he shared my private messages and voicemails to him with her. he outed my other ex to her and my family and nearly outed me in the process. (i didn't need help, by the way. i think he could feel me pulling away.) 5. i told him not to contact my friends or family again. he did, twice. and he shared an email where i'd poured my heart out to him, and more. 6. while we were working on our relationship, he was involved with multiple other women and lied by omission. he now says he never lied to me and is trying to rewrite history while accusing me of doing that. 7. he suggested mental health diagnoses for me that he knew would hurt me. (no, he's not a therapist.) he shared his therapist's suggested diagnosis for me with me. his therapist told him he shouldn't do that, and criticized him (told him he weaponizes his intellect). he quit therapy after that. 8. after we broke up, he reported my posts on r4r-type subs even though they were following the rules to try to get them taken down. i'm also fairly certain he reported my dating profile, though he claims he didn't. he tracks my reddit activities and sometimes tries to shut me down. i'm sure he's telling lies to do that. he may even find this post, even though it's a new account. 9. one time, i said i hadn't heard of this small private school and asked him how he knew it (thinking perhaps he or a friend had some connection to it) and his response was a snarky, ""i read."" (for the record, i also try to read and stay on top of things but i don't know everything.) 10. he was incredibly judgmental of others. i realized later that it was because he's incredibly sensitive to criticism. yet he'd say i was the judgmental one. that one took me longer -- i realized he was projecting. 11. he is a terrible driver. the third worst driver i've seen. in the two years we were together, he accidentally ran multiple red lights and stop signs. i was always hesitant to give him too much feedback because of how mopey he'd get. 12. it became clear to me that he thought he was too smart for most people. he didn't have a job for years because he couldn't figure out what he wanted (he was well off enough to not need a job). he wanted to help the world and...did absolutely nothing. didn't volunteer, didn't do anything part-time. just read and took walks. it sounds like a nice life until you realize how sad and lonely it is. 13. he would accuse me of things i hadn't done and then, when proven wrong, move on like nothing had happened. 14. he would sometimes try to make me believe that i hadn't felt certain ways or done certain things for reasons i believed. when we were together and after we broke up. 15. once, he pressured me into taking a health supplement i didn't want to take. it made my heart's rhythm go off pace and i felt awful. 16. i just generally never felt like i was smart enough to be with him. he claimed he loved my mind but then judged others in such a way that made me feel like there was no way he could mean it. that's on me, mostly. i was too insecure. 17. after we broke up, he'd sometimes give me the silent treatment if i didn't say something he liked. i felt pressured to say certain things just so that he'd talk to me so that we could keep working on our relationship. 18. most of his few friends are his exes. he couldn't understand why i didn't want to meet them. i was his first relationship to last more than a few months (he's 41). still, he described some of them as being intense. 19. he once told me he'd leave me if i got an abortion. this is mostly just an incompatibility, but it still hurt. 20. most of my past relationships were pretty normal and ended for the usual reasons: incompatibilities, distance, etc. i was in two abusive relationships, one when i was young. he once said i like to find abusive men and be in those kinds of relationships. (which i don't, but if that we're even true, then what does that say about him?) this is also with him knowing i'd dealt with abuse growing up and knowing that the person in the first abusive relationship had raped me. i definitely didn't ask for that. there's probably more. some of these are toxic and emotionally abusive, some are just red flags and poor emotional boundaries. i made mistakes as well, and there were good times, too. of course there were. i used to love him so much. but when i reflect, i wish i hadn't met him. it would have been better for both of us.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.013071895424836602,-0.0018674136321195146,0.08683473389355742,1.0,0.0
"how can i let go of you the day i started letting go of you was when the idea of us was sure to exist, in my mind, in every way. i had to let you down; the sweet reality of us and the bitter reality of me never held hands. funny enough, i started making the surety of us into the wounded child. she giggled, for she was down for every possibility of us. wounded children never dream, for the hope of dreaming caused them a lifetime of not achieving it. they yearn, they beg, they never let go, they never move on. when we both nodded, you were nowhere to be seen. that's when you let go of us. when reality of us not existing surfaced, the wounded child yearned and begged for you. but this time, i didn't give her what she wanted, for i have loved you enough to let you go. her tantrums grew; in your absence, the need for you grew. that's how she was conditioned. she can't see what's right in front of her, but something light years away. that explains why she loved the sky so dearly. she ran, ran to the arms of people who wounded her. but this time, i took her pinky and asked, “what if i stayed this time?” the bewilderment sprung on her face. she looked at me as if i am a clown who jumped out of the box, shocked by my words and my clowness. she still needed ears for her cries, so i gave her mine and the people of whom i care. her cries were haunting. her wails echoed through my mind, leaving me unable to function. she demanded to know the reason for your leaving. you never gave any, so i had to make her many. out of which bloomed anger and hatred for you. why did you choose to love me? or did you ever love me? your fast assurance of your love for me was just your way of deluding yourself of your capability of loving another, only to realize you can't. ……and many more conclusions i made of you.",breakup,1,1814.0,360.0,2.0,0.005555555555555556,0.019444444444444445,0.08611111111111111,3.0,0.0

"well i once dated a psychopath and i'd just like some imput they're the one's who broke up with me being “my mental health was affecting them in damaging ways“— didn't once tell me that they were concerned about it and i had to talk with their mom so they'd give me a reason because before they just cut me off without saying shit! and funny thing was that they had anger issues- like to the point if somebody had a different opinion they'd wish death on that person and talk about how they'd kill them- not to also mention that they talked about wanting to kill my dad by breaking his back... and they also “joked“ about wanting to spy on me, cut my private parts if i were to cheat- forced me to think about some sexual things involving them even though i clearly stated i wouldn't be comfortable doing that. and there was one time i was like “sorry but... could you not talk so hateful around me...? you could always talk about it with other people though!!“- and they basically snapped at me saying that they're not in the wrong and i just have to deal with their way of coping with anger. there was also another time i was wishing them a speedy recovery when it came to a physical injury and they snapped at me too for it because they were ""appalled“ by me wishing them to heal quickly because they considered that impossible. they also called my jokes dumb a lot and generally whenever i brought up an issue they either were like “omggg poor me i'm now suffering “ or “eh, whatever sorry you feel that way.“ while whenever they brought up an issue with me i'd have a mental breakdown and beg for ways to make it up to them. oh- oh! they're also basically joe goldberg/jd from heathers/chae yul from secret alliance and ever since i was the one to cut contact the second time- they've been stalking me online a bit :(((- these are just some little bits i remember!",breakup,1,1869.0,351.0,2.0,0.005698005698005698,-0.002849002849002849,0.07977207977207977,1.0,0.0
"a bit of help. i’m at such a low point. i know that there are often posts like this where people ask what certain things in a break up mean and we try find understanding in all of it. it’s 3 months post breakup. it wasn’t a relationship that i wanted to end even though it had its the emotional abuse i endured throughout was something i believed i needed to put up with as “karmic justice” for people i’ve hurt along the way. and eventually what led to the break up was when my ex gf took photos and shared pages of my journal with her friends and family. the contents of the journal have spread and the narrative of our break up has changed many times where in the one retelling of the story my dad had passed away? there’s a lot of context that i have omitted because this post will become too long. but i am at such a low point. this break up hurts me everyday. i have been hospitalised for suicidal ideation. i have started exercising, i have started cbt therapy and new meds but day by day this pain gnaws at me and it won’t stop. i feel so attached to someone who has just so easily walked away. in the break up i respected her and distanced myself but all it’s done is led to me being blocked everywhere by her and her sister except for whatsapp which confuses me. i know that each break up is different but the pain we experience is similar and peoples actions are more or less the same when processing these feelings. but i have lost so much of myself. i can’t trust journaling because of how it was weaponised against me. i feel like i am carrying the emotional weight of it all. while my ex is out partying and making it known. i have lost my way. i just need some guiding light to point me in the right direction .",breakup,1,1727.0,343.0,7.5,0.026239067055393587,-0.0058309037900874635,0.10204081632653061,1.0,0.0
"the heart is slower than the brain i just checked my calendar and apparently it’s been 5 weeks since the break up. i broke nc throughout the first week to ask for his side of the explanation and to clear some misunderstandings, and about a week after that, i broke nc yet again by sending him a link to a firework event in his city, because i stumbled upon it on instagram and he likes fireworks and remember him saying he wanted to watch one. that turned into a conversation, where he basically said that he was already feeling better and healing 2 weeks since the break up, while it has been a rollercoaster for me. i asked if i could be honest and he said it was my call and to bear the consequences. i said i missed him and how we could be very open and comfortable with each other, etc. he said he’s trying to detach from me, not rely on me and find other source of entertainment, not get more hurt, and i’m making it harder for him. i was asking if there was any underlying reasons as he ended things abruptly after sponsorship was brought up (we were 5 months ldr nevermets who were gonna meet up in the 8th month, i was gonna move to him from the west coast to the east coast after working on getting my own pr in the next 3y, and he was gonna let me move into his place in his province). he said no, and it was really just because he lost trust, lost love, and he thinks it’s not worth it anymore to put effort into this relationship because we’d just keep hurting each other so it’s better to end things now than later when we were more committed. towards the end of the conversation, he said that the longer i latch on, the worse it gets, and that i’m really close to reaching his limit to block me. i said okay, i’m sorry, i’ll let you go, and i won’t text / reach out ever again. he previously said that blocking hurts him more and feels toxic, so he prefers not to block. so i’m keeping my last words to him, that’s all i can do now.. i just checked and it’s been 19 days since that last conversation and actual nc. but anyway… i’m writing this because i don’t wanna keep bringing my friends’ or my sister’s mood down… some of my friends are also going through a hard time and i just want my sister to enjoy her trip to the fullest, so it’s kind of like journaling and i don’t really have to say sorry here since people are free to read something if they want to and skip if they want to.. so… a few days ago.. was my graduation day.. i cried during a speech that asked us to look at the people who have been here for us and made it possible for us to get this far, because he wasn’t there, he’ll never be there even in the happy, easy, proud, and big moments. i was grateful to have my family attend my convocation, but it was a challenge for me to pretend as if everything was okay, and to smile in the pictures. now.. i’ve been in a tour to the rocky mountains for 2 days now with my family since they’re staying with me for about 2 weeks to make the trip worth it and today we had a cruise in the maligne lake in jasper, alberta. it was magnificent. serene, calming, beautiful. but there were times when i thought that i wanted to share this with him.. but i can’t anymore.. i wanted to make a joke about the captain’s parking skills because we played sea of thieves together.. but i can’t anymore. i’m not even the type to post on instagram, i just use it to view public accounts’ posts. i really just thought that the view was too good not to share with him. but.. he doesn’t wanna hear from me anymore, he doesn’t care anymore.. these past few weeks.. i’ve had less jokes come into my mind that i would’ve otherwise told him to make him laugh. i threw away the flowers from the bouquet he sent me that i dried, so it’d have lasted for years instead of weeks, ‘cause looking at them everyday reminded me of what i lost, my regrets, and what happened. and i’ve let myself cry whenever the tears come, instead of holding them in except when i’m in front of family. i’ve reflected a whole lot, and know that i have a lot to work on (and have been working on) like thinking more positively, believing in myself more, not saying or thinking bad stuffs about myself especially if i don’t even mean it or don’t truly think that way, being more patient & taking things slow, work on my communication skills, not dwelling / replaying conversations, passive aggresiveness, not overthinking, thinking before talking, worrying too much, thinking too far ahead and a whole lot more. have been learning about attachment styles and relationship psychology as well to try and understand better about why and how he just lost love so fast like that. i thought the relationship was good and mostly secure most of the time, we were on good terms, and only had 2-3 serious talk, that was it. never fought or been in a huge argument before. my brain has accepted that it’s over, that he doesn’t wanna be with me anymore, that there’s no going back, he’s never coming back. and i wasn’t even planning to take pics or vids to share with him, but when i was at the place… it just came to mind. it was so abrupt… it all happened so fast.. i know i’ll get through this but damn. i thought i was getting better these days. then it just came back again..",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,6.0,0.0057859209257473485,0.008678881388621022,0.085824493731919,0.0,0.0

"ghosted by girlfriend ghosted by girlfriend (1.5 year relationship) hey everyone, i've been feeling like i need to talk about this, but have been unsure where to post it. hope this place is okay. (also posted in r/ghosting) so i (20m) had been in a long distance relationship for around a year and a half with my girlfriend (19f). things were going really well, had a few ups and downs as with all relationships, but overall things were great and we had plans to meet (which i had been saving for for a while, had just gotten enough to visit her). however around 3 months ago, she got super busy with exams and other activities. so we didnt talk at all for like a couple weeks, which sucked, but it was fine i guess. however, eventually that 2 weeks turned into 2 months. after her exams she just didnt reach out still? she stayed gone, didnt say a single word. we still had eachother added on various platforms, so i could see her online activity. she would play games with complete strangers, all while still ignoring me. i figured she was just going through some stuff, so i gave her some space, only messaging every 5-7 days. it was clear in many of my messages that i was very upset, especially given we have had conversations in the past about how this kind of behaviour really hurts me. she knew how i felt, she knew the pain i was going through, and yet she still continued to ignore me. eventually, about a month ago, i just had enough and sent a lengthy message laying out my emotions, while still reinforcing that i still loved her very much. finally she responded just a few hours later, saying she was sorry and we agreed to find a time to voice call about everything. so we did that, and she explained how she had been having doubts about the relationship and didnt know how to bring it up, and at the end of the call she broke up with me. i of course was very hurt, but i forgave her initially. but after taking a couple weeks to think about it all, i realised that what she had done was honestly bordering on emotional abuse, or at the very least its extremely cruel. i decided i couldn't forgive her, and although we initially agreed to stay friends, i changed my mind on that. how could someone put anyone through that kind of pain, let alone their partner? i sent a new message to her, telling her we could no longer be friends, and laid out my feelings about what she had done more clearly and honestly than i had previously. i told her in this that i believed it was borderline emotional abuse. because even if she didnt intentionally hurt me (so she says anyway), she 100% knew how i was feeling, and still chose to keep ignoring me. at this, she got extremely angry, claiming i was being insensitive and nasty because she had been in an emotionally abusive relationship before. even if its quite harsh wording to use, i do believe its completely valid. all of this is to say, ghosting is completely disgusting. fuck anyone who ghosts their partner or friends. during that time i was being ghosted, it destroyed my self worth, my mental health, and i felt extreme anxiety and depression 24/7. i was the best boyfriend that i could be, even if not perfect, i did not deserve that. i'm not sure everyone will agree, but in my opinion, ghosting is emotionally abusive. please, no one ever do it. thanks for reading my ramblings 🫠",breakup,1,3348.0,611.0,3.0,0.004909983633387889,-0.0032733224222585926,0.0867430441898527,2.0,0.0
"what does it mean when my ex replies like this on her birthday? hey guys, i posted here before about my breakup, but i’ll quickly summarize so you have context. my ex and i were together for 3 years in a long-distance relationship (about 400km apart). the breakup wasn’t because of distance or a third person — we ended things on relatively good terms, though the last year had more arguments, sometimes over small things. there were even a few failed attempts at breaking up before, but around christmas, when she visited me, she told me she wanted to end it for real. after the breakup (early january), we still talked a fair bit during the first month. then we had a period of no contact, but about a month after that, she texted me saying she missed me and that she’d probably message again — but it’s now been 3 months since that, and i hadn’t heard anything. yesterday was her birthday. i decided to send her a simple “happy birthday” out of respect. she saw the message 7 minutes after i sent it, but didn’t reply until about 2 hours later — and all she said was “thanks.” what do you think this means? was it just politeness? does it show she wants distance? i can’t stop overthinking it.",breakup,1,1196.0,222.0,7.0,0.03153153153153153,0.009009009009009009,0.07657657657657657,4.0,0.0

"i feel lost i don’t usually post anything on reddit. i’m more of a reading type of person, but i really feel lost right now and have no one else to ask. my stomach drops thinking about her moving on to someone new, and experiencing different things with somebody else. i got broken up by my first girlfriend of 2 years. it was my fault. i had so many issues that she was willing to wait for me to be better, but i ran out of time and she got tired. it broke my heart but i believe i did deserve it. it’s been two months since, and the pain i felt that day hasn’t left yet. we didn’t block each other, it ended on relatively good and civil terms, but we are no contact. i’ve been working hard to become a better person, of course for myself but also for her. everyday i wish for her to come back, for her to see that i have gotten better and will continue to, but it seems like she moved on. she seems happy without me, like nothing has happened. i admit, i still stalk her account and check everything (literally) that i can, because it’s like the only “connection” i have with her left. i am happy for her, i rather her be happy without me than sad with me, but i’m left with all of the pain. my stomach drops thinking about her moving on, completely stop loving me, loving someone new, and experiencing different things with somebody else. i still have some friends and family which i am very grateful for, but i can’t really talk to too many of them about my situation. i do many things with others to be happy and enjoy my life still with them, but it feels like everything i do is temporary happiness, until i’m reminded of what happened and how she is gone. now i don’t know what to do. i have loved her for more than 6 years (4 years of chasing and 2 years being together), and lost the chance of her being the one i was gonna marry (we both wanted each other to be forever). i still want to chase her, i really want to break no contact but i fear that it might be the wrong decision (maybe push her farther away), at least for now. even if i do, it feels as she wouldn’t care to read what i have to say anymore. i’m not ready to move on yet or give up and i still want to try, but it seems so difficult, especially because the chances of her coming back seem so slim. what do i do?",breakup,1,2289.0,464.0,7.5,0.023706896551724137,0.015086206896551725,0.11206896551724138,1.0,0.0
"i’m grieving hard over the person i thought i fell in love with (3 years together) this was my first ever relationship starting at age 26 and i just turned 29. she was my first love and i thought she loved me back. i wanted to marry her and grow together. she broke up with me on 06/28 because she felt not only was she “holding me back” in achieving my goals but also because of recent familial events cumulating in her feeling like she hasn’t been prioritizing her own mental health and focusing more on myself and others and wanting to better herself by losing weight (we met when she was 140lbs and recently up to 230lbs) the whole situation felt like a total cop out and in my own opinion she just wanted an easy way out in the relationship because she got bored of me, lost attraction, and was more interested in somebody else or even seeing them for god knows how long behind my back. it always felt like i was walking on eggshells for the past couple of months to a year, when she also mentioned having been contemplating breaking up, and she kept snapping at me almost like she was resenting me and blamed me for it. she told me over and over that she was telling the truth and she wanted to focus on herself and couldn’t do that in a relationship. i’m not fucking stupid. that was absolutely a lie and i swear it was to save face and i’m sure on some level it was to ease the pain of telling me that she was actually interested in someone else but i would’ve rather her have told me that she no longer wanted to be with me than lie to my face. in hindsight there were little red flags sprinkled here and there that i should’ve called her out on but i didn’t because i never thought she would hurt me that way. honestly, looking back i think she used me the whole time and none of it was real on her end; but to me it was real. when i met her, this little child in me sparked right up and now she absolutely killed him and any last bit of love or feelings i ever felt. the entire text messages sounded like she was a cold and calculating therapist trying to ease me through the process of a breakup instead of the woman i thought i knew and loved. to say i’m heartbroken is an understatement and i don’t think she’ll ever tell me the truth that what she really wanted was out and latch onto someone else. i don’t think she ever really loved me at all from the beginning. we started relationship counseling and everything was going great, even she said so. then a few days ago i mentioned, out of curiosity, if i had never mentioned relationship counseling, would she have. and she said “… i don’t know” and then mentioned wanting to break up. she probably used that as an opportune time to break it off. the whole day up to that point we were enjoying each others company. she never cared or loved me at all and sometimes i wish i had never met her. i gave her everything i had in my heart and soul and she fucking killed the little kid in me. i know for a fact that she’s probably in bed not giving two single shits about any of this and beyond happy that i’m finally out of her life. i gave her everything i had and it was never going to be enough.",breakup,1,3159.0,624.0,6.0,0.009615384615384616,0.011217948717948718,0.10096153846153846,0.0,0.0

"my ex used psychological warfare against me this is not your typical breakup story, she left me paralyzed in every aspect of my life and made sure to hurt and damage me as much as possible - all while she's hoping me to do well on the surface. we were together for 3 years, 3 years of love, harmony, care, she used to call me, she used to tell me how much she loves me, spend the rest of her life with me, that our love was divine, that our love was special, that our love was forever, eternal, that our souls are intertwined she left me knowing that i would be suffering while pretending like nothing happened, laughed at me when i asked for her help multiple times, she ghosted me after telling me "" i wish i can't sleep so i can spend more time with you"" i was going insane for a whole month, calling, texting, even emailing her, and all i got was a dry response ( i'm working on myself and evolving i need space and clarity) = she was processing the breakup. no courage to tell me that she was breaking up with me (avoidant pro max) we were so close, texting every hour and calling for 2 hours a day minimum and calling in the morning and at night before sleep, i wrote her hundreds of poems, hundreds of love letters. i was her father\\mother\\best-friend\\lover\\husband. some of you might not grasp this but that's how deep was our relationship. we promised to be together forever, we made so many promises and she broke every single one of them, with no regards, no respect, nothing. i lost my sanity after she ghosted me, i couldn't process anything. i couldn't eat, sleep, i lost weight and i was fainting. everything hit me like a nuke vaporizing me to atoms, the pain i felt can't be described with words, it's the worst thing a human can feel, worse than death. i was dying everyday not knowing what's happening to me, physical pain, physical heartburn, physical trauma i was experiencing every pain possible, i was shivering nonstop for weeks my body was cold. i was begging her to answer my calls, my texts, i was pleading for help nonstop. but this meant nothing to her, she turned ice cold like i was nothing to her absolutely nothing. at the end of the month of her ignoring me, she started texting me back with delayed dry responses, and the first thing she tells me, she's installing a dating app and wanna date new people. i begged her to stop, i said let's workout whatever the problems is like adults, i will apologize and do everything you want. but it was like talking to a wall, she was doing anything she wanted and whatever was convenient to her. and this even not worst thing yet. i tried to calm myself down with any means possible and thought maybe i'm truly a bad person and she deserves someone better than me. maybe someone will make her happier than i did maybe maybe maybe. but 3 days later she tells me that she matched with someone and they're going on a date. this hurt me like hell i was burning from the inside and i still wished her to be happy and she said the ""same"" ahahahahhaha what a pathological liar. now here's the bombshell that struck me and shattered me to my core, the guy she matched with ( directly supports the people who were responsible for the murder of my father and uncle) she bragged to me about how good it was to make out with him for a straight hour, how good it was to have sex with him. that he was bigger than me, she said it was better than the 3 years of love she had with me. she deliberately made sure that i knew who she was sleeping with, and how much it would hurt me, for 3 years i warned her and told her how much pain these people have caused me, they ruined my life. and her reason for all of this ? is that i asked her about her past experiences and questioned her about them. that's why she broke up with me, that's why she done this to me. she denied and rewrote our history, lied, and said leaving me was growth and evolving. she said i was holding her back and controlling her. i don't know how to deal with this, i don't even know which pain i'm feeling anymore, nothing is stopping, i lost half of my weight, my hair is falling, i'm barely eating anything to function. i'm feeling unfathomable heartburn, betrayal, physical pain even feel worse now, i'm in total despair. i lost my sanity. i can't even think coherently. and no therapy won't work on me i've tired before don't even think of suggesting this. it's been 4 months since she left me and everything have gotten worse since then.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.01555023923444976,0.0035885167464114833,0.11483253588516747,1.0,0.0

"i 20m unexpectedly met the girl of my dreams 20f soon after ending a 3 year relationship and i feel awful!! i guess i’ll start from the beginning of the end. i recently broke up with my girlfriend of nearly three years for a number of reasons. i won’t get into the details, but it wasn’t a messy breakup—we agreed to stay friends. i still love and care about her deeply, but it was just time for us to go our separate ways and grow, like so many others eventually do. after the breakup, my plan was to focus on improving myself. i told her this, and reassured her that there was no one else—i genuinely meant it at the time. i had no intention of getting involved with anyone new for a while. but, of course, life had other plans. about a week after the breakup, i got a text from an old acquaintance (not really a close friend) asking if i wanted to watch the sunset and catch up. she had no idea i’d just broken up with my girlfriend—i hadn’t told anyone. at first, i didn’t want to go. even though it seemed harmless, i wasn’t ready to hang out with another girl. but then i thought, if i’m trying to grow and do things differently, maybe i should step out of my comfort zone. so i decided to go. within the first ten minutes of hanging out, something just clicked between us. the connection was insane—we were so similar, and it felt refreshing to talk to someone on the same wavelength. after that first hangout, i just thought i’d made a new, really close friend. we kept in touch, hung out a few more times, and quickly became close. it felt good to enjoy each other’s company. then, one night, we were hanging out and drinking, and she didn’t want to drive home. i told her she could stay at my place—she’d take the guest room, i’d sleep in my bed. we put on a movie, and sure enough, we started making out. but it didn’t last long—i just couldn’t go through with it. it felt wrong. after being with the same person for three years, it was hard to be with someone else so soon. my body almost rejected the idea. i felt terrible, thinking i might lose her as a friend, but she was understanding and didn’t want to lose me either. we agreed to pretend that night never happened and kept hanging out. but we kept getting closer. within a week, we were sleeping over at each other’s places, cuddling, and doing cute things together. still, we weren’t having sex—i just wasn’t ready. eventually, we both admitted we had feelings for each other. but we also agreed that dating wasn’t an option, since i’d just gotten out of a long relationship and we both have to go back to different colleges soon. so we’re in this in-between space: not just friends, but not dating, and not sleeping together. we just love each other’s company and care about each other a lot. she honestly feels like the girl of my dreams—it’s just not the right time. now, i feel awful. how can i tell my ex that i’m not seeing anyone and focusing on myself, then start hanging out with someone new just a week later? i know i’m allowed to feel how i feel, but it still aches. i care about my ex and want the best for her. i don’t want her to get hurt if she finds out i’ve been spending time with someone else so soon. i’m supposed to pick my ex up from the airport in a couple of days, just to give her a ride home—because we’re still friends, and our breakup wasn’t messy. but the new girl doesn’t know about this, and i’m not sure if i should tell my ex about what’s going on with the new girl, or just keep it to myself. if my ex finds out, it’ll break her heart. on the other hand, i don’t want to ruin things with the new girl by picking up my ex, because i know how that might look. i know i’m a good guy at heart, but i feel like i’ve dug myself into a hole i can’t get out of. i don’t want to hurt either of them. i don’t want my ex to think this new girl was the reason we broke up—because she wasn’t. and i don’t want the new girl to think i’m getting back with my ex—because i’m not. i care about them both. i just need some advice.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.022754491017964073,0.00718562874251497,0.11377245508982035,1.0,0.0

"post-breakup living situation as ""good friends"" is confusing me i and my now-ex gf had been together for 7 years and have been living together for 5 years. she broke up with me a few weeks ago saying her emotional connection with me had faded away in the last few years. she said she still likes me as a person and also had a bunch of happy moments, but she didn't think we were meant as lifelong partners. we talked a lot since then and opened up about each other much more than we did in the last 7 years, which we both appreciate. in a nutshell i have my set of problems that turned me into a stressed-out egoist, and she has her set of problems that made her a conflict-avoiding person who pretends like everything is fine until it’s too late to repair the relationship. i’ve been an emotional wreck, but i’m doing what i can - changing my habit, taking a therapy for the first time in my life, seeking medical attention to my mental health. i knew i probably had issues for a long time (adhd, depression, burnout) which had been affecting not only our relationship but also pretty much every aspect of my life, but i had never really opened up about them or took any actions to address them because i was afraid and also one of the big issues i have is procrastination. anyway, we’re still living together. in the morning she comes to my bedroom to say good morning. when she comes home in the evening (i work from home), i welcome her home. we then cook dinner and eat together. just like how we lived for the last 5 years, except there’s now a bit of physical distance. we share a hobby (sport) which we are both passionate about, and even after i’ve started living alone, we’ll still see each other on a weekly basis. just this weekend we went to an event related to the hobby that we had planned to go. shared hobby also means we have a lot of mutual friends, and some of them are our closest friends as well. but she says she hasn’t told anyone about our break-up (except for a couple of her closest friends outside the community). so people naturally assumed we were still a couple. i was trying to spend as much time as possible separately, but she was still sticking around as if she didn’t want others to find out we broke up. all this is really confusing me. on the surface we still look like a couple, and even at home we’re still more than just roommates. i know she didn’t make the decision to break up lightly or hastily. perhaps she’s just being considerate while i’m still grieving. but it’s making it really difficult for me to let go of the false hope we can still get back together.",breakup,1,2606.0,504.0,6.0,0.011904761904761904,0.007936507936507936,0.10119047619047619,0.0,0.0

"breaking toxic patterns before they break me [m 28] and her [f 28] what's so wrong with me? why do i behave like this? let me start by saying that i \[m, 28\] have been in therapy for 9 months now, and i plan to continue. my therapist is good, and she's helping me unlock things little by little, but there's still a long way to go. i've been with my girlfriend \[f, 28\] for 7 years. basically, she’s convinced she wants kids, and i very likely don’t. we made a compromise: if after a year i still don’t want them, we’ll break up. for me, even making a compromise on something this big doesn't feel right. knowing that i’ll probably never develop the desire to have a child, it feels stupid to waste her time. every day i think i’ll talk to her about it, but then i don’t. i’m not very sexually attracted to her. that’s always been an issue, and lately it’s gotten worse. i have sex with her just to please her. it’s horrible to say, but that’s the truth. i feel uncomfortable while doing it. recently, i had a shitty situation at work. i went through a long hiring process for an important job, managed to get hired, and in two months i’ll have to move to a new city—so on top of everything else, our relationship is about to change. my therapist says i struggle to talk because i come from a family where problems were never addressed, and any time i tried to express anger or disagreement as a kid, i was shut down. my parents recently separated after 30 years of marriage. their marriage had clearly been failing for a long time, and they put off the decision forever—maybe out of fear of hurting the kids, maybe out of fear of hurting each other. it feels like i’m repeating the same pattern, ending up hurting both myself and the person i'm with. of course, our relationship has had good moments too, but right now i’m focused on the problems. which are massive. and i tried to keep it short. if i read about someone else in a situation like this, i’d think, “what the f\*\*\*?”—yet here i am. how do you break out of a vicious cycle like this?",breakup,1,2051.0,399.0,4.0,0.010025062656641603,0.002506265664160401,0.09523809523809523,4.0,0.0

"unexpected breakup i 25m and my girlfriend 22f have never had more than 4 arguments over our entire 5 year relationship. we have lived together the entire time we’ve been together and haven’t spent more than 3 days away from each other. recently she stayed at her sisters house for 10 days to take care of her animals while she was away on vacation. seemed a bit odd to me considering she didn’t inform me that she wouldn’t be coming home during that time and it isn’t like her sister lives super far. her house is literally 5 minutes away from my girlfriends work so whenever i heard that she was going to be taking care of the animals i assumed she’d stop in before work on her lunch break and on her way home but this was not the case. she packed up her stuff nothing unusual just mainly clothes and makeup. and out she went and i’m not going to lie i was pretty salty about the situation but i didn’t say anything because i figured we would make plans to see each other. fast forward during the week she was away not one time did she try to invite me over, call me, ask about our own animals or have any substantive conversation. i know i’m also wrong for not trying to make plans but i will say it was mainly because i was still hanging on to why she told me the night before she’d be gone for the next 10 days. anyway one full week after she originally left to go stay at her sisters house she sends me a message expressing that we should break up. and it was not a long thought out message, probably 6 to 7 sentences max and there was only one vague reason that she said was the reason for it. it was that she felt like we had just become “roommates”. now i didn’t disagree with her about that because we had been in a rhythm in life where things were kinda just slowing down. i told her that i agree with how she feels and that it’s not because the love isn’t there we just haven’t done a good job at putting enough effort into us. i also said that it is something that all relationships go through especially whenever both parties work full time and just wanna get home and relax sometimes. nevertheless we had a series of conversations that ended off in a better stop than they began and we would start the next day and her vibe would do a complete 180 of how we ended the conversation just the night before. my issue with all this is that she never mentioned how she was feeling before all this started at all. everyone in our life was dumbfounded when they heard about what is going on. my other issue is that she is completely unwilling to work to fix things one bit, i have been understanding and and reasonable in our talks and she just doesn’t have much to say other than she doesn’t feel the love and that its a gut feeling that even if we do work through things that it’ll just end up back at this point. this whole thing is very out of character for her not just with the way that she’s treated me during it but also how she is closing off other people in her life about talking about it. she is also just carrying on with her life as if nothing is going on at all. i just never saw this coming and i don’t understand why i am not getting solid reasons for this one sided decision and i’m not sure how i’m supposed to handle any of this because like i mentioned before we never fight and this is not normal behavior from her. i keep convincing myself that she’s having some type of mental episode because there are other factors in her life that i know have been really hard for her and i feel like i am the one that is receiving any type of punishment. i’m just really lost right now and wish that i could know what happened the 10 days she was away. there’s also more details i can provide if anyone needs them but yea has anyone had a similar experience or any advice for me?",breakup,1,3797.0,687.0,4.0,0.005319148936170213,0.007978723404255319,0.07712765957446809,1.0,0.0

"the breakup letter my boyfriend works on the road and is coming home wednesday, i’m not sure how or when i’m going to tell him it’s over but i know i have to. idk if this short novel should be kept to myself or shared with him. hey, i’ve spent a lot of time trying to make sense of things, trying to rationalize your behavior, give you grace, and hold space for your silence. but i’m done doing mental gymnastics for someone who clearly wouldn’t do the same for me. people make time for what matters. they communicate. they show up. they try. and “i’m working and having a lot things going on” might explain a rough patch but it does not excuse treating me like i’m disposable. everyone is going through something. not everyone uses it as a shield to hide from basic decency. your two weeks away are spent completely absent from the relationship. and then the one week you're home? i end up begging for even a sliver of closeness. it didn’t start this way. in the beginning during your first hitch, even your second, you tried. you called. you texted. you showed up emotionally, even from a distance. i wasn’t asking for constant attention, just connection. just effort. so no, this isn’t some “she doesn’t understand my job” situation. this isn’t me being needy. this is about the very real, very painful truth that you’ve grown lazy and complacent in this relationship. now, two months in, you brush me off. you ignore me. you throw out half-hearted excuses that don’t even make sense and i’m supposed to pretend they’re valid just to keep the peace. that’s not partnership. that’s not care. that’s not what i deserve.you’ve made me question my worth, second-guess my instincts, rewrite reality just to justify your inconsistency. that’s not care. that’s not complexity. that’s manipulation dressed up as depth. i’m done pretending that emotional unavailability is mysterious or profound. it’s not, it’s just cowardice, and i’m no longer romanticizing someone who can’t even treat me with the bare minimum respect they’d give a stranger. that tight feeling in my chest? that spiraling anxiety? that wasn’t me being needy or insecure that was my intuition screaming. and next time, i won’t silence it just to make someone else more comfortable in their romantic laziness. because when someone says they’re “too busy” or “too complicated” for honesty, what they really mean is: i like access to you without the responsibility of showing up for you. i want the benefits of closeness without the inconvenience of being accountable. i want to be seen as a good guy, even though i’m acting like the opposite. i was never asking for too much. i was just asking the wrong person. so this is me choosing myself. if something feels off, it is. if i have to constantly explain away someone’s behavior, i already know the answer. if i’m giving more chances than i’d ever receive, then it’s time to walk away. even though what we had was short, my feelings for you were real. i genuinely cared about you, and i was starting to feel hopeful, even excited about what the future could look like with you. that’s what makes all of this so disappointing. because i wasn’t playing games, and i wasn’t holding back. i showed up with an open heart. i’m saying all of this not to attack you, and not because i need to feel like i have the upper hand. i’m saying it because i genuinely hope you grow from this. i hope that one day, the next woman in your life gets better from you, more presence, more care, more effort. i hope you understand the part you played, the things you avoided, and the effort you didn’t make. this isn’t about proving a point. i don’t need to be right. i just hope that something in what i’ve said sticks enough for you to reflect, to be real with yourself, and maybe to do it differently next time. because you could be a great partner… but not if you keep choosing comfort over accountability. is it too much?",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,3.0,0.004016064257028112,0.012048192771084338,0.07630522088353414,4.0,0.0

"love alone isn't enough, you just can't force compatibility a 4-year relationship just ended with someone i genuinely believed i would build a life with. we were deeply intertwined: emotionally, physically, and practically. we even lived together for several months. but despite the closeness and the love, the relationship ended; not out of hate, betrayal, or a sudden fight, but because the foundation wasn’t sustainable anymore. he told me he felt like the relationship was full of micro-compromises, from how often we communicated, to sex, affection, sleep routines, and daily decisions. over time, those adjustments drained his sense of peace and autonomy. he said he realized that while he still loved me, he didn’t want a life that constantly asked him to negotiate himself. that hit hard, but i understood it. one of the biggest areas of compromise was our sexual compatibility. at the beginning of our relationship, we agreed to explore sexually with others. i tried to embrace that dynamic with him because it made him happy, but i was already starting to feel off about it. over time, i realized it wasn’t something i wanted anymore, but i kept pushing through because i didn’t want to take something away from him. when i finally expressed that i couldn’t do it anymore, he agreed to stop. that was a big compromise for him. then came the aftermath. i had some emotional and sexual trauma from the whole experience, and it led me to doubt our intimacy and even my place as his partner. eventually, this made me feel unsafe with the idea of him using porn too. so i asked him to stop. and he did. even though it was a big part of his life and identity growing up, he gave it up because he acknowledged the trauma i carried and wanted to give us peace. and we were happy again for a while. but i see now that a lot of that peace came from his huge compromises. he kept adjusting and shaping himself into the partner i needed, based on what i asked for, to the point where he was kind of losing himself. he had to negotiate what he actually wanted just to maintain the version of us that i needed. i also had my struggles. i did feel loved, but only because he was constantly shifting his words, actions, and even his schedule to fit what i needed. i was happy and felt secure because he cultivated a version of himself and created a relationship that allowed me to feel that way, even if it came at the cost of his own comfort and authenticity. he told me, more than once, actually, that he just doesn’t belong in a relationship anymore. he tried to end things before for the same reasons, and i understand it better now. he wants the freedom to live entirely on his own terms, with no expectations or responsibilities tied to another person. even if i were to ask for the bare minimum in a relationship, it would still feel like a compromise to him. and that kind of life, one where his peace, his space, and his autonomy are constantly negotiated, just isn’t what he wants anymore. he said something that stuck with me: “you’re grieving a whole version of your life. but from my side, that version only existed because i kept compromising. we were happy, yes. but it wasn’t sustainable. it was always going to end like this, whether now or later.” there was no in-between. if we settled and he stopped his compromises, i’d feel unloved. if he kept adjusting, he’d lose himself. the only real solution was letting go. it wasn’t a lack of love. there was so much love. but love wasn’t enough to carry us through fundamental incompatibility. this was the third time we were at the edge of ending things. it just took this long for us to finally accept it. we still care deeply for each other. we laughed every day, shared so many memories, and genuinely enjoyed each other’s company. but love alone wasn’t enough. you just can't force compatibility. right now, i feel like i’m staring at a blank calendar. the relationship took up most of my free time and most of my week. when i wasn’t in school, i was with him. so now that it’s gone, i don’t really know where to start. i don’t know how to rebuild my life or reclaim my time. a lot of the things i enjoyed, even my hobbies, were so tied to him and our routine that it’s hard to know what’s still “mine.” i want to reconnect with myself, but i’m overwhelmed by the space he used to occupy. i’m trying to be kind to myself and stay grounded. i know healing takes time. i know i’ll be okay. but right now, it’s just hard. if you’ve been through something similar, i’d really appreciate hearing from you. how did you get through it? what helped you rebuild a life that felt like your own again?",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,2.0,0.00228310502283105,0.019406392694063926,0.08447488584474885,2.0,0.0
"letter to my ex i’m writing this here instead of to you, because i need to let it out but can’t let myself be controlled by emotions to write it to you. i want you to know, that i truly and deeply cared about you….our connection was so strong and special to me, and i thought it was for you too. maybe it was. i don’t know. i opened up to you in many ways, that i never do with most, and i accepted you. i knew your story, you had a hard life growing up just like me. and you had no family. i valued our relationship so much. i did and would have been so caring, loving, and loyal to you. you told me you were going to marry me. we would have a family tougher, that that’s all we ever wanted since we came families that were broke. when we would be together, it was always amazing. i felt calm, safe and like i found my soulmate. but then, there was always an issue with time. i asked to see you and spend time with you, you’d say you’d try and sometimes we did and then most of the time there was something that came up on your end. then you said you are dealing with something and don’t have the time for me right then. i responded back to talk through it all but you never replied… just ghosted me…for 2 months. then you came back, a couple days before my birthday, trying to rekindle… seeing your name pop up was surprising… i never expected to ever hear from you again… i was hesitant and also confused and hurt. i was already starting to move on and accepting that you didn’t want to be with me anymore… it was a painful process. then i decided to open up my heart again and give things another chance. things felt great again, you said how much you missed me and wanted me in your life forever, and that i make you happy… and i felt the same way. things were fine for a month, then you couldn’t give us the time again. it was always something- work (and i get it), a family member, or other things that you said were taking up your time. i just asked to work through it with you, but you ended up seeming to get tired and just gave up, saying that you don’t have the “proper time” for me. i understand there are priorities in our lives but to not have been able to find time for us just hurt and made me feel like i was at the back burner. for someone who always wanted a family and to marry someone you considered your true person, that made no sense to me. the messages were even beginning to slow/be less, not even a photo of each other like we used to send in between our meets, just to see each other…and then i tried to talk through it with you, asked for a heart to heart. you never replied, until this day. it’s been almost a month now. and then i saw on my feed from our mutual friend that you went on a small trip to see them/ “family”. i get it, but you never had time for us? not even a day worked? no matter how much i pleaded, felt like i was begging… begging for your time, love and attention. so after seeing that, i deleted you off social media. because that hurt me so much. and you adding new girls to your socials recently just makes it all settle in… breaking me to complete pieces. you really moved on that fast? how important was i to you? the connection you said was rare and special…yet all i ever did was ask for time, for care, for a future with you? that was a lot to ask for i guess…. i thought i was important to you. i thought you cared about me. even if things didn’t work, ghosting me yet again after i poured my heart out hurts even more this time around….you have no idea how much this has all broken me internally…. i was so loyal and caring and you meant so much to me…. i haven’t even thought of talking to any other guy, because i had a small glimmer of hope that maybe you’d reach out again and we could work it all out. but not now, you clearly don’t care about me after what i’ve seen…i see how much i truly meant to you…. i am dealing with this pain alone… it’s so hard. it feels so callous of you but i see this is what i needed to finally accept the truth… a part of me thinks that you aren’t truly a bad person and just have things to heal from…and that you did care. but it’s hard to believe after all of this. i feel like everything was a lie… i just feel so broken and am trying so hard to be okay. one day i hope to forgive you. and to heal from this. 😔😢💔",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.008968609865470852,0.004484304932735426,0.1031390134529148,5.0,0.0
"i’m still not over my breakup and i feel so guilty about it (21m) hello, so a little bit of context: i’m currently in a bit of a bind. i’m in nursing school right now, and i’ve been stressed out of my mind with the paperwork. at the time, me and my my then-girlfriend now ex (21f) were on a for 3 month break because she had kind of a mental breakdown after coming down from her university upstate to visit me. we were together for 4 and a half years; she was my longest relationship ever and we met as seniors in highschool. before coming down, she had just been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and it culminated in her snipping off a piece of my cat’s fur with scissors that almost made me kick her out of my house entirely. anyway, we had a 3 month long break, which i decided to end after finishing my ob/peds final and got back in contact with her. she was kind of distant and didn’t really want to talk to me, but i gave her space. eventually, she said she felt better on the break and i concurred. despite some things like her wanting to move on, i considered it a pretty smooth, mutual breakup. deleted all mentions of her, cut contact, the whole shebang and felt nothing. not long after, i downloaded a bunch of dating apps and i found a lovely girl that i am so glad to have met. we’ve been dating since march and things have gone really well. which is why i feel guilty, especially since i absolutely cannot talk about this with her. about two weeks ago, i started watching steven universe with my friends and something about that show pulled repressed feelings about the breakup out of me. after certain songs/episodes, i started having reoccurring nightmares about my ex. waking up in her bed beside her, reconnecting with her, but it all felt…wrong. and the nail in the coffin is that i found old photos, voicemails, videos, etc. from when we were in highschool that i thought i had deleted. now, i can’t stop thinking about her even though i know what we had wasn’t perfect. i met her at a point in my life where i didn’t really have direction and she provided me with that direction. i wouldn’t be in nursing right now, if not for her. but, she also made me feel like i needed to repress parts of myself to be her partner. i can’t in full confidence say that she was a terrible person, just that there was a lot of stuff going on between the two of us that was healthy and wasn’t healthy. but, all of this contemplation has made me feel terrible because i’m with a wonderful person who loves me and i’m here stuck in my own head. i thought i got it out of my system, thought i was over it completely. now, all of these feelings have resurfaced and i don’t know what to do. what i do know for sure is that i am not getting in contact with her again. i want to heal and be better for the woman that i’m with now, she deserves everything and more. i just feel so worried that i’m going to get trapped in my own head and miss what’s important now. thank you for listening",breakup,1,2983.0,591.0,7.5,0.018612521150592216,0.00676818950930626,0.11505922165820642,0.0,0.0
"struggling to let go after 13 years together — torn between history and healing hi everyone, my therapist suggested i try opening up in a space like this. i’m in the middle of an emotional tug-of-war since separating from my ex — the person i’ve been with for 13 years. we started dating when i was 16. we never married but we have two kids together and a long, complicated history. over the years, we’ve broken up and gotten back together more times than i can count. last summer, i left. he told me he was ready to change, and i still loved him, so i moved back in. but within a couple of weeks, i knew i’d made a mistake. i stayed until the week before christmas, despite feeling severely depressed — like i was losing my will to keep going. i’ve made mistakes in our relationship. i struggled with addiction, and there was infidelity in the past. but i’ve been in therapy and working with psychiatry since 2017. i’ve done — and continue to do — the work to become a better version of myself. he once apologized and admitted that during my lowest points, he would “rub my face in the dirt.” that has stuck with me. i’ve been out of the house since december. i’ve started dating someone new — someone kind, consistent, and supportive of me and my kids. he shows up in ways my ex never did. i can see a future with him. but despite that… i still feel emotionally tied to my ex. my family and friends call him manipulative — some even say he’s narcissistic. and a lot of times, i agree. when i read back through my journals about the things he said and did, it’s honestly disturbing. no one should have to endure that. but then he swears he’s changed. he says he’s not that person anymore — and now he’s planning to give this “new version” of himself to someone else. that’s been hard to sit with. he recently told me he’s getting close to giving another woman his “loyalty” and is making a decision soon. and honestly, i think i need to respect that. but it hurts. i had always hoped that if we were ever going to try again, it would be with intention — with therapy, growth, and accountability. i’ve told him i still get anxious and uneasy around him. almost every time we talk, i walk away feeling confused or emotionally scrambled. but he doesn’t want therapy. he says we should just “naturally find our way back” — and that i’m too demanding now, that my standards are too high, and it’s probably too late because i didn’t give him a real chance when i left. meanwhile, i’m working full-time, raising our kids, going to nursing school, and dating someone who actually wants to build a life with me. but i’m still stuck in this emotional loop, wondering what if. i think the hardest part is the guilt. i left because of the emotional abuse. but part of me still believes maybe he treated me that way *because* i was such a mess back then. like it’s somehow all my fault. if anyone’s ever been in a similar place — stuck between knowing it’s over and still feeling like you can’t let go — how did you move forward? how do you accept that it’s really done, even when you gave so much of your life to someone? thanks for reading. i really needed to let this out.",breakup,1,3163.0,609.0,7.5,0.013136288998357963,0.003284072249589491,0.10837438423645321,2.0,0.0

"realizing she was checked out of the relationship way before it ended i know it seems obvious that if someone breaks up with you it’s because they’ve thought about it for a while, but it just hurts still. we were long distance and the breakup was mutual. ultimately we weren’t good for each other and we both have a lot of growing to do on our own. i won’t get into specifics but i really believe i did my best throughout the relationship in every way but it never seemed enough for her. then she’d apologize for making me feel like i’m not enough for her, then not change her ways. i gave too much of myself over to the relationship, which i know is my fault, and i wouldn’t blame her if she found it to be too much, but when i tried to do things for myself like work out and eat well and be more social she would get irritated. in the moment she always seemed glad, but she later told me she got a strange irritation whenever i would tell her about those things. and she knew it was wrong to feel that way. but she still did. i never understood that. it made me feel like i couldn’t tell her many things if she was secretly getting irritated if i mentioned how much i’m enjoying the gym or something. i started seeing a therapist and after the first session went really well, i wanted to tell her about it. she told me she didn’t need to hear about it because if she was in therapy she’d keep it all to herself. i get that of course, but this first session i had was literally just me and the therapist getting to know each other. i never understood that either even when i asked why. she admitted to me a couple months ago (we broke up two weeks ago) that she felt she had been taking me for granted, and that immediately made me cry. i’m a pretty emotional guy, so when i heard her say something that i didn’t even know i needed to hear so badly, the river started running. looking back, i have realized all the times i felt the best in the relationship were times when she would apologize to me for making me feel a certain way or for saying something mean. i know that sounds awful but it’s true. the rest of the relationship (even though i didn’t fully realize it) felt kind of suffocating and when those moments of clarity came it was like christmas. she could be pretty mean to people she loved (including her family) due to her anger issues. anyway, i could go on and on but i guess i’m just now realizing that she truly was checked out of the relationship for a while and never had the fucking balls to just tell me. she was dropping these hints and i guess i always ignored the implications because it scared me (which is wrong of me i know). i just feel almost used and taken for granted and wildly disrespected. we made a clean cut after the breakup and haven’t spoken at all. we said we’d like to hear from each other at some point so we can see how we’ve been. because we do truly care about each other, but now i do not want to speak to her any time soon at all. i just feel slighted. i didn’t deserve that. after 2.5 years together and having feelings for each other for 5 years, i didn’t deserve that. i know it’s all in the past and i can’t change it now, i just feel sad. any words or thoughts are wholly welcome. thanks. ps this has been a great sub to browse whenever i’m feeling particularly down or lonely because it immediately reminds me that so many people are going through the same thing. it’s hard to remember that for me sometimes since i’m 21 and still learning to navigate life, but yeah. thank you.",breakup,1,3533.0,687.0,3.0,0.00425531914893617,0.0014184397163120568,0.10212765957446808,0.0,0.0

"love is a weird feeling but don't lose sleep over it. no matter how strong you are, there was a relationship that almost took you to the mental hospital. you don't really understand how much damage love can do until you find yourself questioning your own sanity. there was a time when you were unbreakable, confident, stable, sure of yourself. and then came that one person, the one who knew exactly how to pull you in and tear you apart at the same time. they didn't just hurt you. they made you doubt yourself. they made you feel like you were the problem. like your feelings were too much, like your love wasn't enough. you lost sleep, you lost weight, you lost yourself. one day you were laughing and dreaming about a future together and the next you were staring at the ceiling trying to make sense of the chaos in your mind. every argument felt like a battle for your sanity. every silent treatment felt like suffocation. you kept telling yourself that love was supposed to be hard sometimes, but deep down you knew this wasn't love. it was survival. and the worst part, walking away didn't immediately fix it. the damage stayed long after they were gone. you had to relearn how to trust, how to breathe, how to exist without feeling like you were constantly on edge. but you made it. somehow, despite everything, you found the strength to pull yourself out of that darkness. and now when you look back, you don't see weakness, you see survival. because no matter how close you came to breaking, you're still here.",breakup,1,1520.0,273.0,2.0,0.007326007326007326,0.018315018315018316,0.0,0.0,0.0
"my (36m) girlfriend (31f) of 6 years broke up with me today on the anniversary of of my mother’s death. i don’t know what to do my i guess ex now broke up with me today after coming home from a trip to see her family and friends. we’ve lived together for about 4 years and have had a pretty good relationship for the most part, the same ups and downs most couples have and we’ve worked on our issues whenever they’ve come up. we’ve been talking about getting married and there have been some issues there. she’s not sure she wants kids or not, i do but i’m not fanatical about it and could just as easily not. i’m 37 in two weeks so at this point i feel like if it happens great, if not, fine. i’m also jewish and she isn’t and that’s been a sticking point but not a massive one and i’ve communicated that. a couple hours after she got home she started being cryptic and i point blank asked her if she was wanting to break up and she said yes. i don’t, i love her more than anyone, she’s my best friend and my home. okay fine typical breakup i guess, but here’s where it’s really killing me. 1. we live together in a state neither of us are from and have no friends or family here. the closest friends or family being a 7 hour drive to the next state over, and we have 6 months left on our lease and neither can just afford to leave. 2. my family is a complicated thing, so skipping the unnecessary details, i was adopted at 13 by my former foster mother who had been so because my birth mother was severely mentally ill and adopted me later for the same reason though i maintained a relationship with my birth mother even though my adoptive mother was every bit a mother to me. my birth mother died…uh…by her own hand (don’t want to upset anyone) and today is the anniversary of her death. also worth noting that my adoptive mother passed away unexpectedly two years ago this october. i have no other family outside of two half siblings i don’t have a relationship with, and an uncle i also don’t have a relationship with. the fact is my family is gone. my gf’s family had taken me in basically and now i have no one, and it’s all happening on the day that i memorialize the loss of my mom. 3. i have two dogs, one of whom we rescued “together” (before we moved in together but while we were dating) as a 6 week old puppy, and my other dog i had before she and i met but she was still basically a puppy. this might actually be the hardest part for me. in 6 months my ex and i are going to go our separate ways and these dogs who, have really only ever known her and me, will be losing her. one day for a reason they can’t understand, she’s going to go away and they’ll never see her again and that part is breaking my heart almost as much as losing the love of my life and my best friend. i don’t know how to handle this part especially. they don’t react well when she leaves to go home for a few days, they don’t eat, they stay by the door, they don’t want to play. my sadness is just beginning but theirs is still six months away and it’s killing me. i feel like my entire world and my future has been obliterated and i have to live in the wreckage for half a year and then i have to say goodbye to my best friend and i have to see my dogs deal with the abandonment. i’m very lost, and i would be lying if i said i wasn’t on the edge here. i think maybe the dogs would be happier with her, i could leave them with her and the balance of my savings account to take care of them and i could join my family. i just don’t know how to deal with this. it came completely out of left field and it feels like an actual nightmare that i can’t wake up from. i’ve had breakups before and never like this. they hurt, it sucked, i left and moved on. i can’t imagine how people handle divorce especially with real kids if this is even one tenth of that experience. i just needed to get that off my chest. thank you",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.018703241895261846,0.0012468827930174563,0.11221945137157108,0.0,0.0
"communication matters - broke no contact. felt good. i’ve been consistently seeking advice online—here on reddit and even through chatgpt—about what to do with my boyfriend, who broke up with me but kept giving me breadcrumbs. i was deeply sad during that time, so i turned to others for guidance. the most consistent and solid advice i received was this: don’t contact him, don’t initiate any conversation, and strictly follow the no-contact rule. i managed to follow that rule for about two weeks—or maybe just a week—despite him sending me consistent breadcrumbs. he’d message that he missed me, that he loved me, but never once did he say he wanted me back. still, i held on to the advice from reddit and chatgpt not to reply, because they were just breadcrumbs—nothing more. and honestly, it felt empowering. it was incredibly hard—i cried a lot, even dropped to my knees in tears, unable to function properly at work—but it gave me a sense of control. for once, i felt like i had the power. i was the one setting the boundaries, sending the message that things wouldn’t be easy anymore. but let me tell you this: while i was maintaining no contact, he kept messaging me, saying how much he missed me. and something inside me started to feel unsettled. what if he really had something important to say and i was just ignoring him? what if he needed to say something he couldn’t say unless i responded? that thought led me to break the no-contact rule. i replied, “yeah, i miss you too.” and that was the moment he opened up. he told me everything—he apologized, he expressed himself, and he became vulnerable with me. you see, the no-contact rule works in certain cases—especially when you’ve been mistreated or abused, or when you’ve finally decided you deserve better. it’s helpful when you need to walk away from a relationship that causes more harm than good. but if you truly love each other, and you’ve simply had a misunderstanding, why torture yourself by strictly following no contact? communication is essential. talk to the person. speak your mind. be clear with each other instead of sitting in silence and trying to guess what the other person means. just communicate. respond to the message. and if that conversation doesn’t bring peace, healing, or respect—then that’s when you stop. at least you tried. at least you listened. and what you hear will help guide your next decision.",breakup,1,2400.0,437.0,7.5,0.036613272311212815,0.006864988558352402,0.07093821510297482,3.0,0.0

"my ex contacted my other ex help! this is the single most violating thing i’ve ever felt, and being that there isn’t anything else on google search on reddit, i decided to post. for starters, i am (34m) and both of my ex’s (31f the recent ex) and (35f) broke up with me. 35 and i broke up back in january. we didn’t stop talking until march, it was not like we were speaking romantically, just having conversations about our day. we broke up in january, but we’d been not seeing eachother much since november. when i met my recent ex 31f i formally cut it off with the other ex 35f (ended communication). my recent ex 31 and i met in march. much of the relationship was me dealing with deep rooted insecurities, abandonment issues and (despite fighting me about this) is a fearful avoidant but doesn’t know. i spend an incredible amount of time dealing with being called a manipulator and a gaslighter. granted, the accusatory nature of our arguments caused me to spiral (get flustered, get confused, have my avoidant tendencies come out) this is pretty typical of fearful avoidants especially trying to get them to address issues, take accountability, or understand your perspective. anyway, my recent ex 31 and i broke up a week ago or so. the short of it is we technically broke up a week earlier, i sent over my grievances since i felt like i wasn’t being heard and accepted it. she broke up with me, blocked me on everything and then reached out to my other ex 35. i only know this because my recent ex 31 unblocked me to call me a horrible person a gaslighter and a manipulator because of what she had “learned”. i sent her a message on another number, saying i’m sorry it ended i’d be here to talk about whatever it was she was talking about when she was ready. really polite just asking her to please not make it messy. she called me names and blocked that number. the other night my recent ex (31) she unblocked me and sent me audio recordings and photos my other ex had saved i guess. i was in absolute shock because this was an insane violation of trust. on both of their ends. i tried to give both of them closure. ultimately they ended the relationships not me. i send the non recent ex (35) an audio recording apologizing for my part in the relationship (although i’d tried to give 35f closure. and it didn’t go well or at least wasn’t fufilling but 1. she’s not entitled to anything. 2 i tried. and 3. she was the one that checked out and pulled away.) i also set the boundary that i was going to ghost both of them if this continued. but was open to dialogue to try and chill this situation out as i’ve known 35f since highschool and we were good friends then. to be honest though, i not only had the thought to block both of them but also file a restraining order (i don’t think it’s reached that level though) regardless of my communication issues and problems i unfairly brought into the relationship. i treated both of them really well. really was a rockstar boyfriend to both of them. they took me for granted, they stop respecting me, and they left. i accepted both of the breakups. i understand the crossover between both of them and one ending and the other beginning overlapped. but the first one 35f, was over long before i cut off communication. i haven’t heard anything since i sent the audio message. i know there isn’t anything i can do. i don’t want to be with 35f, haven’t been since the breakup. and 31f i’ve tried to be understanding of her issues but up until i got that message i thought maybe we could reconcile. right now i’m at 1 in a million of that happening because lets be real, if no boundaries exist in a relationship it isn’t a relationship. and the chances of someone seeing what they’ve done and taking accountability for it and healing as a person is 1 in a million. so i think it’s gonna be a no from me just wanted the communities thoughts. because i’ve never heard of anything like this before but this is incredibly out of character for 35f, and i’ve known her for nearly 2 decades. and the other one i haven’t known long enough, but i was absolutely crazy about the girl. absolutely blindsided by this and want some advice. also, she got my ex’s number because she made me block her, and i guess took the number down. (insecurities) i’m being called a liar and a manipulator which i don’t care about, i know my truth but like why is there no respect? no boundaries? just trading shots for sport is honestly sick. one last point of clarity, i didn’t want to be with 35f although she broke up i was feeling like it in the weeks running up (she didn’t show up to christmas although she was a few blocks away) we just weren’t right for each other. good friends. but not right thanks for the help.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.02993348115299335,0.004434589800443459,0.10421286031042129,2.0,0.0

"how can someone just not show any signs of caring anymore? my ex and i have been broken up for 6 months, today. we are both female. i am 26, she is 25. i broke up with her, because she was very controlling when we were together and even went to my work, parents house, etc to make sure that i was there. also let her mom control how she felt on a lot of things, how she felt about me included. despite our differences, i loved her very much. it just wasn't a good fit. when we broke up, she sent me a huge paragraph saying that she wanted to stay in contact and i was fine with that, i just wanted to be on good terms. not even a few days after that conversation, i was blocked on absolutely everything and was told that she was doing it out of love for me. a month or so later, she was already in a new relationship with another girl, who had just turned 20! i've tried reaching out to check on her, but received nothing back. i can't help but think that i cared more and she just threw me away or maybe just found someone younger and easier to manipulate. thoughts? she also went to her ex girlfriend after our breakup and bashed our sex life, my body, etc. just wanted to add.",breakup,1,1179.0,231.0,7.0,0.030303030303030304,0.017316017316017316,0.09956709956709957,2.0,0.0

"it's been two weeks [original post here]( today marks two weeks since we broke up. it's been tough. the first couple of days i was an absolute mess, and now 14 days in, i still kind of am. it does get easier. but it also gets harder. everyone who tells you the weight gets a little easier to bear with each passing day is right, but as that weight is lifted i'm beginning to feel an emptiness. any joy i've found recently is fleeting. there's a void left in my heart, an absence in my life that i feel so deeply. i think about her all the time. when i think about her too much, i cry. i cry for what we lost and what could've been. i cry for all of the things i still wanted to do with her, that now may never be. i cry because i miss her so desperately. i just want my best friend back. the last time we saw each other was one week ago, so we could talk and get a bit more closure. she still loves me, and i still love her so much. she just isn't ready to commit, and she feels she can't give me everything i need. that she can't give me all of the attention i deserve, and that she can't love me as much as i love her. i told her she was enough, but she said she didn't want to just be ""enough"". she was my first relationship, and she felt like i couldn't know what was ""enough"" for me without having the chance to experience a relationship that could give me more than she can right now. she felt like she was robbing me of experiencing that. i told her i still love her, and she said if that's still true in a few years, we can check on that. the hardest part about this breakup is it does feel... necessary. for both of us to grow, this had to happen. in these past two weeks i realized i was relying on her to be whole, relying on her to be happy. i grew complacent with a lot of things in my life as my life began to revolve around hers, rather than us revolving around each other. she was the center of my universe, and as circumstances had it i was not the center of hers. i need to be the center of my own universe. i feel like once we've both grown more, we have a chance at trying again in the future. it's a paradoxical thing though, as in order for that to be even a remote possibility i need to fully move on. i need to let go of that possibility if it's to ever happen. i need to open myself to other people, and i need to be okay with her being with other people. it hurts, imagining her with someone else. and when i imagine myself with someone new, all i can foresee is myself comparing them to her. i know it will take more time than two weeks, but even still - i don't know how i can ever be over her. how to stop loving her, how to stop thinking about her. we've known each other since we were 16, best friends for years, and we'd been dating for over half of our adult lives - both our first serious relationships. losing her has been the hardest thing i have ever had to go through.",breakup,1,2906.0,585.0,3.0,0.005128205128205128,0.003418803418803419,0.10598290598290598,0.0,0.0
"long distance ghosting / blocked i talked to a girl for almost two months. we facetimed nearly every day and got emotionally close. we opened up to each other, shared personal stories, made each other laugh, and talked about what it would be like to finally meet in person. she lives in vancouver, and i live in calgary. eventually, we made a plan for me to visit her. she invited me to stay at her house, and just two days before my flight, we confirmed everything. we even had a call to go over expectations and rules for staying at her place. she told me about a restaurant she wanted to take me to. she also told her parents and her sister about me, and her sister even saw me on facetime. we made a detailed schedule for the trip, and about a week before my flight, she told me she missed me and that she couldn’t wait to see me. then, four hours before my flight, she suddenly said her feelings had changed and that i couldn’t stay at her place no matter what. she had hours even days to tell me sooner, but she waited until the last possible moment. i was shocked, but i still got on the plane, thinking maybe we could talk or figure things out in person. but when i landed in vancouver, she ghosted me completely. shortly after, she blocked me on everything my number, my social media, every way to reach her. she knew exactly when my flight landed, and she chose to cut me off right after i arrived, knowing i had nowhere else to go. i can’t help but feel like there may have been someone else involved. she said a “friend” was over the night before, and her entire energy shifted out of nowhere. after two months of closeness, daily conversations, and confirmed plans, she left me completely alone in a new city without explanation or closure. she didn’t just change her mind she waited until it would hurt the most. that’s not confusion. that’s deliberate. that’s not how you treat someone who cared about you. and that’s something i’ll never forget.",breakup,1,1961.0,371.0,2.0,0.005390835579514825,-0.0026954177897574125,0.09973045822102426,0.0,0.0

"got back together with an avoidant, dumped again a month later all my friends and family told me not to get back with her if she asked, should have taken their advice lol. fell for the oldest trick in the book. we split up about a month ago, with the textbook avoidant style. i didn't even know anything about attachment theory before coming to this sub, but it all makes so much more sense now. the early rush, love bombing, making you feel anxious by flipping a switch to randomly go cold and distant (while acting as if they're doing nothing wrong and you're the crazy one). we got back together literally the next day when exchanging things; we both agreed we didn't want to lose each other and we could make it work - because we worked so well together. we promised each other that we would talk and address any issues we had head-on so we wouldn't be in this situation again. what an idiot i was to believe that, right? because here i am, one month later, and the exact same thing has happened again. went cold due to some bad family news, claimed i wasn't there emotionally for her (i was literally checking up on her constantly, asking if she was okay) and saying that she felt she was pulling both our emotional weights because i was calling her out on her coldness. i don't get avoidants. i can't tell what would be worse - if they are aware of their behaviour, or if they have zero idea what they're actually doing to people. the people they're supposed to care about the most. just a few days ago on thursday night she was telling me how happy she was and how glad she was we worked things out, planning future trips etc etc. then 24 hours later going distant and cold again. as soon as it happened, i could see the writing on the wall and knew what was coming as it exactly matched what happened last time. oh, and you know the real kicker? yesterday when we broke up, we had a phone call that morning where i confessed my anxieties and was vulnerable with her - she assured me that we were fine and i had nothing to worry about. then broke up with me that evening. (via text, i might add! how noble.) what drives these people to do this? she really is just textbook avoidant, matches all the stories i've been reading here lately. we never really had any arguments, which makes more sense now - at the time i saw it as a good thing, but no, turns out she'd been bottling up all that resentment this entire time and it all came out at once (despite her constantly reinforcing we needed to talk about problems in a healthy relationship!!) do not make my mistake, dont get back together with an avoidant. not unless they specifically state they are aware of their issues and are working to fix them with therapy etc. even then, i would be sceptical. my love genuinely goes out to all those suffering from heartbreak from an avoidant. they *absolutely* exist and they will give you the worst, most blindsiding emotional pain you can go through. fuck these people.",breakup,1,2973.0,548.0,6.0,0.010948905109489052,0.005474452554744526,0.07116788321167883,3.0,0.0

"blindsided by my girlfriend breaking up with me immediately as we got home after a camping trip — i don’t know how to move forward hi everyone, i’m really struggling and could use some support or perspective. i (30m) was just broken up with by my girlfriend (24f), and i feel completely blindsided. we had just gone on a camping trip this weekend with her friends. while i felt some emotional distance at times, we still shared meals, talked, kissed, and told each other we loved one another. i truly thought we were okay — or at least that if something was wrong, we could talk about it. but shortly after we got home, she ended the relationship. she mentioned some concerns — mostly about finances and some emotional misalignments — but none of it was ever clearly brought up as a serious issue during the relationship. in fact, just two weeks ago, she wrote in my birthday card how she had seen my growth, how proud she was of me, and that she “wasn’t going anywhere.” since we met, i’ve been actively working on myself: paying off debt, going to therapy, learning better communication, and trying to build a future not just for me, but for us. i know i’m not perfect, but i’ve been truly trying to grow — for both of us. i sent her a heartfelt message after the breakup — not begging, just sharing honestly how much i love her, how much i want to work through things, and how shocked i was. i haven’t heard anything back yet, and the silence is unbearable. i feel completely shattered. this isn’t just a breakup — it feels like losing the future i thought we were building. i don’t even know how to sit with this pain. has anyone been in a similar situation — where you didn’t see it coming, and you felt you weren’t given a chance to work things out? is there any way to come back from something like this? or how do you begin to let go of someone when you still believe they’re the love of your life? any support, advice, or shared experience would mean a lot right now. --- tl;dr: my 24f girlfriend suddenly broke up with me (30m) right after a weekend trip together. i thought things were fine — she even told me two weeks ago that she wasn’t going anywhere. i’ve been working hard on myself and thought we were growing together. i feel blindsided, heartbroken, and don’t know how to move forward or make sense of this. i’m desperate for advice or perspective. please help",breakup,1,2380.0,447.0,5.0,0.011185682326621925,0.011185682326621925,0.09843400447427293,3.0,0.0

(our wedding was coming up in may) he refused to respond to my calls or messages and refused to allow me to speak the girls after 3 years of me raising them. he demanded his family members that were still friendly to me stop talking to me. and he started sleeping with a new girl about a month later it was at that moment i wondered if i could actually die from a broken heart 💔 it’s just been unbelievable. like a nightmare. i’ll never understand truly why i didn’t matter enough to fight for us 🥺 to discard me so easily, our life together our future…it feels as if it was all fake. was i used? 5 months later i still cry, i no longer lose sleep but i do wake up from time to time sad. i think about him and the girls every single day and miss them so much. i find myself saying “oh he would love this” or “i should buy this for the girls” when that is no longer my life. i see his car type everywhere when i never noticed it before, our favorite tv shows come on and i find myself picking up the phone to call him to tell him about jasmine and gino 😂 then i realize we no longer speak, i hear songs that i know he likes and sometimes i smile sometimes i cry, when i cook i get sad because we used to cook together, those stupid tarot card readers keep popping up on my tik tok fyp telling me he’s coming back (don’t worry i know they’re fake but it does make me feel better 🤦🏽‍♀️) i have realized that what he did was not ok, i don’t deserve to be treated like that, no one does regardless of what i did. i’ve also accepted the fact that just maybe the universe or the lord himself removed him from my life because i refused to see all the red flags. either way i try my best to keep going. i just really miss the man i met and the life we had in the beginning. the hateful man at the end, i never want to see him again.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.010683760683760684,0.0,0.10363247863247864,1.0,0.0
"always trust your gut hi everyone, i just need to let this out somewhere… for months now, my gut has been telling me that my boyfriend wasn’t being honest with me. there were constant red flags..his behavior never matched his words, he would ignore me for hours or even days, mute my calls, disappear without explanation, even though i never pressured him. i’ve had so many conversations with him, hoping things would change, but it was always the same cycle. yesterday, i finally caught him in a lie. so last night, i packed up all his stuff and left it in front of his door. i’ve decided to cut all ties and never look back. what makes this even harder is that he owns the gym i go to… my safe space, my routine, a place where i met wonderful people, join a community… and now i feel like i have to give that up too. i already sent the cancellation email, but honestly, this is going to be really tough. just needed a place to say it out loud. thanks if you’ve read this.",breakup,1,973.0,190.0,1.0,0.005263157894736842,0.010526315789473684,0.1,0.0,0.0
"need advice for a confusing and complicated good term break up desperate for advice.sorry this is a bit all over the place. my now ex boyfriend 25m ended it with me 19f 4/5 days ago. as much as it still hurts i completely understand why he made the decision. he needs to focus on himself, as do i, and that's ok. we live together so not only have i had the thought of losing him on my mind but also my home. we've agreed distance is needed but he as reassured me all my belongings will be untouched for as long as i need until i have somewhere permanent to live. the first two nights were awful, alot of inconsolable tears from me. (this break up brought up alot of emotions from traumatic experiences growing up). he was so patient with me through this and was as comforting and caring as he could be while keeping his distance. night 3 he stayed the night at a friend's so we could both have some space which was very needed but when he came back the next day i couldn't take how distant he was being with me, which again i completely understand why but it still hurt. it felt like he was a hologram and every time i tried to touch him my hand just went through. i figured i had to leave the flat which really i should've done on the first night but i couldn't bare leaving my safe space, my home in such an emotional state. during those few days we made it clear to eachother we care and we love eachother (this was communicated healthily, not in a mindfucky kind of way). it's so bittersweet knowing this, it would almost be so much easier if we hated eachother but at the same time i'm so appreciative of the fact that we're good. yes we're not in a relationship but i haven't fully lost him, he isn't necessarily going anywhere. i had a moment where i told him we couldn't be friends because it would hurt to much but not long after i said that we could be friends because he's too important to me and he agreed. he said this is the first time in a breakup where the other person hasn't hated him or he hasn't hated them loland the first time it's been on good terms which means alot to me. we saw eachother today (after only leaving last night) since we had it planed anyway. we walked around the park in the area we grew up in and just talked. when we first met up we were both a bit awkward/hesitant on what to say but very quickly we were talking and joking like normal, i thought i'd have a negative emotional reaction to it but the whole thing was actually very reassuring and comforting. it was so nice to just be with him and to have some sense of normality. by the end it felt like he was trying to make it last a bit longer like taking us down a much longer route to leave the park when we already decided we were leaving through a quicker exit, then when we'd left the park he suggested walking a little bit of the bus route before getting on the bus (i know he doesn't like being alone, especially after the fact we've been by eachothers side nonstop for months). he walked me to my next bus stop and waved me off, as he did he looked so sad and it really hurt to see. during one of our conversations we'd planned to see eachother in 3 days then decided it would be better to see eachother next week instead as to not push anything. we've also planed a day in the next week or so for me to go over and get ready for a night out then stay the night when my night out is finished since our flat is in the city so this would be more convenient but more importantly, it would be safer than me getting back to where i'm currently staying. i'm very relieved we have some sort of plan/structure as to what's going to happen for now moving forward. i think in the first few days i got over the worst part of my negative emotions in regards to not being with him anymore but since i know we're ok at the moment i'm not as upset at the moment. i know this will take time to get over. now more than anything im homesick. i want my bed and my space so much it's killing me. i'm not looking for reconciliation, i am however really hoping he can stay in my life because as i said, he is extremely important to me and i cannot fathom life with out him being present in some way. he's even said when time has passed i'm more than welcome to stay on the spare bed if i need somewhere to go. my fear is as our connection is still strong this could all go wrong very easily. i understand limited contact, distance and boundaries are vital for this but im worried about emotional slip ups from either of us. (saying things we shouldn't in moments of weakness, that sort of thing). if you've been in the same or been in a similar position how did you get through it and where are you now as a result of that? how can i keep this positive and healthy for both sides? little details that might be important: i have a feeling people might come for the age gap, there was no power imbalance and he treated me the best i've ever been treated by a man. we established straight away no intimacy of any kind as that would be extremely harmful to the situation. we're both audhd and share very similar difficulties growing up so mentally this has been taxing on both of us in ways that would be different for someone neurotypical or someone who had a stable upbringing. the breakup was no ones fault, it happend over unhealthy coping mechanisms from both sides. we were with eachother for just under 7 months but were seeing eachother for 3 months before hand and were with eachother everyday.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.014204545454545454,0.003787878787878788,0.08049242424242424,2.0,0.0
"how do i feel the same peace they feel? me and my ex gf were really really close to eachother and it got to the point of being very unhealthy and toxic. in the moment i knew it was bad but i kept going with it because i thought things would eventually work out. fast forward like a month she decides she wants to breakup to work on herself. i could tell the signs were there and it felt inevitable. i lost myself pretty much because she gave me mixed signals at first then became very cold. i begged and begged and begged and begged for reasons why even though she wouldn’t tell me. i go to the hospital because i’m genuinely losing my mind and want to hurt myself. i come out feeling a lot better since i had met some really powerful people in there who really moved me with their stories. then i get my phone back and i went to look at her socials to find that she had been posting about how breaking up with me literally saved her and how you should never settle for less. then i find out a couple more days later that she began dating someone 2 weeks after we broke up and messaging him only a couple days. she was very sad at first and seemed like genuinely destroyed then this random wave of relief hits her a week after the breakup? is this real happiness she’s feeling? i am stuck trying to put together why i was so easily replaceable and how i put so much time and effort into someone who just discards me like nothing. i feel so so lonely and i should be mad at her for moving on this quick and posting mean things about me but i still have the feeling of needing her here with me and i’ll never get that back. i have accepted this i’ll never be with her again but man how do i feel this same relief especially after knowing these awful things she has done since we broke up. we were eachothers first everything so why was it so easy for her to move on and find love seemingly better than ours was, in a week. this guy is better looking than me, drives a lexus, is in school to be a doctor and has a rich family. i don’t know what to do seriously i’m 18 years old and i feel like i have lost everything. i was not even close to perfect in our relationship but she wasn’t either and for her to disrespect me like that while i’m in the hospital feels like something i can’t recover from.",breakup,1,2296.0,462.0,5.0,0.010822510822510822,0.0,0.1038961038961039,3.0,0.0
"ex in a new relationship says she misses me i don't know why i'm writing this, i guess i need to vent a little five years ago, i (m31) met a girl (27) and we quickly became a couple. for three years, things were great: we communicated well, settled arguments quickly, shared the same passions and hobbies. it really felt like a perfect match. then life piled on. money problems, immigration stress, mental-health issues, and covid wore us down, and eventually, her feelings for me faded. we broke up calmly. i listened, accepted her decision, and we didn’t fight. but we never truly separated. for a year, we kept sharing the same apartment (mostly for financial reasons), and after moving out we ended up as next-door neighbours. aside from physical intimacy, we kept acting like a couple: emotional support, joint decisions, dinners, movies, even seeing friends together. everyone thought we were still dating. this year, in march, she met someone new. i assumed i was ready, i'd even downloaded tinder, but seeing her with another guy hurt more than i expected. i was at my lowest and lost almost 20lbs. what didn't help was she kept telling me she felt guilty, that i was the best person she knew, and that if attraction were a choice, she’d choose me over him. hearing that from her, and from our mutual friends who repeated it (because she was telling the same things to them), left me confused. her fling lasted only three weeks, yet it showed me we needed real distance. we agreed to back off but to stay in each other’s lives, promising not to date anyone from our close circle. a month later, i matched with someone on tinder and scheduled a date. then i learned she’d started seeing one of my friends and coworkers. i felt deeply betrayed. i cut ties with her eight weeks ago and haven’t spoken to her since—except for brief work overlap on fridays (yes we are coworker and have to work together for 1 to 2h every friday). fortunately, i’ve had a lot of support from friends and colleagues, even from her brother, who’s one of my best friends. he told me he doesn’t understand her decision and is shocked by her actions because he always thought i had a special place in his sister’s heart and believed we’d eventually get back together by the way she was speaking about me. two days ago, at work, she asked if i was still angry. i told her yes—that i’m nowhere near ready to forgive, and that even if i do someday, it won’t erase what happened. she said she misses me, misses talking and hanging out, but i reminded her that choices have consequences: she destroyed the bond we built over the last five years. and that’s where things stand. for the last 8 weeks, i’ve kept seeing the woman i met on tinder, and it’s helped me feel better. she knows the whole story and accepts it because our relationship has an expiration date, her work visa ends in october, and she’ll have to return to her home country. what we have is somewhere between a girlfriend and a friends-with-benefits situation. i’m grateful for the comfort, but i’m also scared of what will happen when she leaves, worried about where my healing will be and afraid i might spiral down again.",breakup,1,3168.0,588.0,4.0,0.006802721088435374,0.0,0.10034013605442177,0.0,0.0
"why distance + stress breaks couples faster, even when they love each other (neuroscience breakdown) most breakups aren’t about love fading. they are about two nervous systems getting too overwhelmed to connect. here’s why long-distance + stress is such a brutal combo: 1. no sensory regulation • no eye contact to soften messages • no touch to calm the nervous system • no micro-expressions or shared rituals our brains evolved to co-regulate in person. texts can’t replace that. 2. stress hijacks the brain • chronic stress (new jobs, life changes) overloads the prefrontal cortex (empathy, patience, big-picture thinking) • the amygdala (threat detector) takes over small annoyances feel huge. neutral messages feel cold. 3. loss of connection rituals without shared meals, touch, or small daily moments, bonds lose the glue that keeps them alive. 4. the breakdown feels sudden because distance masks these signals, disconnection builds quietly for weeks or months until it feels like love “just ended.” if you have gone through this, what helped you survive or recover from distance + stress combos?",breakup,1,1103.0,170.0,5.0,0.029411764705882353,-0.011764705882352941,0.0058823529411764705,1.0,0.0

"night out drama wired update to my post from a few days ago of emailing my ex. i was on a night out for my birthday this weekend and a club happened to be closing near were i live, i thought that my ex/her family may be out the same night but i didn’t want to miss the closing party and it’s also my birthday so i’d like to celebrate and not let things stop me from living my life. i saw her family as i was waiting in the line, i did a good job in not looking at them and acting like i was talking to someone else when they walked past. it isn’t that i’m scared of the people it’s i don’t want the argument as they are very much loud people (you will find out more about that soon enough) i got into the club, this club has 2 stories so i said to my first let’s go upstairs first take it in one last time then he’d downstairs were the music we mostly listen to gets played. as i walk into the downstairs part of the club i see my ex literally the first person i see is her, from what i remember we don’t make eye contact but i do know she’s clocked that i’ve walked in. i turn to my friend say that she’s there and let’s go to the bar, we head to the bar is about a 20 minute wait. as i get to the actual bar i see out the corner of my eye that her sister is also at the bar on the other side, and i keep seeing her trying to get my attention, like i said i know this will be some loud drama shit so i’m ignoring it. a guy next to me then taps me and gets my attention for her, and she shouts “making money now are we”. whilst i was in my relationship with my ex i happened to be homeless and jobless, and a month before my ex broke up with me i had just sorted out a job for myself and then a few months after she broke up with me i got a flat. so i’m just shocked that she is being so rude and i’m not sure if she’s trying to insult me as it hasn’t worked and instead made me just say “wow fair enough” and just look away and start dancing and laughing because me now having some success is so triggering to her that she will ruin her own night by triggering herself trying to trigger me. it could have also been because i had changed my profile picture and put as the caption “fuck bitches get money” i personally still think even if it’s the latter the action from her in that moment was wired and wrong, my ex and her had a clear conversation after the fact as well and it seemed a bit heated. i end up having a nice night dancing to songs talking about making money 👀😂 and loving every minute of it because it just feel poetic really. as i’m getting ready to leave my friend and i are leaving from the door we come in from and one of my ex’s new friends happens to be next to the door, she stops me and says “i know you” i say “i don’t know who you are what’s your name” in thr job i do i do meet a lot of people and it can be confusing who now knows me and who doesn’t. i did have a feeling she was a friend of my ex but wasn’t sure. she says i’m friends with my ex, i’m like okay i hope she is well, we then end up having a 30 minute conversation and i get her number as she wants to talk to me sober. she wasn’t nasty to me like her sister was the friend was quite kind and said that my ex hadn’t been saying nasty things about me but had said things like “he just wouldn’t change” when she broke up with me i literally said to her “i will change tell me how you need me to” and she had said “you shouldn’t change for people” this isn’t the only things she said when breaking up with me but this is already very long. i would never sit here and say i was perfect i have my issues and i am to the best of my abilities to make the right changes for myself still in know does it mean i’m not the “good guy” in this story i’m just one of the people in this story. from how the friend was talking to me it felt like my ex wants to try again but now with things like her family acting like that, it feels lost from her end but also. it just burnt me out as it was rude and completely uncalled for especially as i hadn’t said a word to them.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.01927437641723356,0.0045351473922902496,0.12131519274376418,0.0,0.0

"i fucked up basically broke up with my boyfriend because i was feeling confused. 3 months out i realize i was being psychologically abused by my dad and that i started to exhibit defensive and toxic behavior when i look back at it. i texted to apologize and told him and was good about catching it sometimes but in the end i was in full protective mode. when i texted after our final fight i said sorry for my behavior i don’t except anything i just needed to own my part. texted a month later asking to talk to explain it more then backed out last second because i got scared told him i was feeling a lot of grief and didn’t know if i could approach a conversation neutrally. i felt ashamed of how i chickened out and have been depressed ever since. he’s def moved on, unfollowed me, and i get why. this back and forth, the constant confusion and uncertainty. i stopped going to therapy because my dad started to talk me out of things. sad thing is that i tried my hardest to fight back this time. in the end i was no match for the emotional abuse and financial withdrawal.

"gf of 2 years ghosted me and is with her toxic ex. how to move on? her family wants to keep me around. my ex and i started dating in 2022, and she had told me about a toxic ex she had that was long distance. and what she endured during that relationship was terrible. her trauma was present throughout our relationship and i wanted to help her and love her. throughout our relationship she would either reach out to her ex, or her ex would reached out to her, and they would talk. i decided to look past it because i loved her a lot. fast forward to april 2025, she sends me a message saying she wanted to break up, that she has unresolved feelings, and that she moved on from her previous relationship quickly. (when we first started dating she said it had been a while since they broke up, then in april she said she got with me only days later.) she left me confused. she wanted to stay in my life after because she said she didnt know if those feelings are valid or if shes making the right choice. throughout april we would meet up everyday talk like we used and i started to get confused on why we broke up in the first place. i asked her about it and she said she still hasnt figured out her feelings and i rode it out. on may 1st i noticed she unfollowed me on ig and i searched her ex's ig and he had made a new acc with 1 follower and 1 following and it was her. throughout may she would say how much she loved me, and wanted me back. i wanted her to figure out everything so that we could have an uninterrupted relationship and one day out of nowhere she said we shouldnt talk anymore that she wants to explore something with her ex. she had told me she hated him, and would never get back with him. she told she followed him on ig to get closure and ask why he treated her so bad. and he didnt say sorry, but when i brought that up she responded with ""he ended up apologizing"" we went a few days no contact after she said ""i choose him"" may 31st i asked if we could go on a walk and she agreed, we walked around and she wouldnt stop hugging me wanting to hold my hand, kiss and we had a good talk, of where she was at and she said she wanted me but needed a little bit of time. then she says shes going on a trip to a different state (where she was born) and after the walk i handed her a note as to why she shouldnt give a second chance, she kept saying she wanted to give a second chance and i wrote a heartfelt letter about it. and once i was home she said she wanted to be a little more honest and told me she was going to that state and get picked up at the airport by him, and be with him. i was torn. we texted more about it. and she kept saying throughout this ""figuring out"" phase, that she was in too deep with her ex to break his heart. and im upset i healed her, and helped her become the best version of herself. we texted throughout the night because her flight was the next day in the morning. as we texted i asked why she wanted to go through with it and she said she doesnt want to keep thinking what ifs, or what couldve been. and i asked why she wouldnt and she said because it would hurt me and possibly a future. she told me she wished she chose me earlier because he had hurt her again before her trip and made her cry. i sent her more heartfelt messages and she replied with ""i choose you, i want you i do, just let me do this car ride, hang out whatever, and face him, ask all the questions, and yell at him. i understand you may not be comfortable but i want to do this."" i told her how i felt and that i thought it wasnt a good idea. she said she wants me but wants everything to be okay. i sent her another essay, and said have a good flight. we went to sleep on the phone. when i woke up i was blocked on everything. i sent her a imsg and she said ""i landed, we'll talk soon but i cant have any distractions"" and that was it. i asked her dad to go on a walk and told him, and he was confused, and angry at her. as june went on and i found out that she has been at her ex's house staying over at his house even when her parents told her not to. i started ""healing"" i would talk to her older sister for hours about everything, and her dad on occasion. ive grown to be really close to them. and theyve been on my side mainly. i made the mistake of looking at her ex's tiktok, and there were posts of them together and her looking happy, and in love which set me back more. i got a last message from her which said ""im with my ex now, leave me and my family alone."" i told her her sister about it and she got pissed saying dont leave anyone alone. her dad also said she brought me into their family, and she'll have to deal with the consequences of her actions. her mom has also supported me. i feel like i have been making close to no progress. i deleted her photos, blocked her on anything i didnt reply to her text. her family is telling me to cut her off but do i cut them off too? theyve been really helpful etc, so i dont know what to do. they told me i deserve better, ill find my person, and that i dodged a bullet. but it seems like their wiping their hands on the situation i told them im concerned about the peace in their family i felt as though me being in their orbit would cause tension and all he said was ""shell be alright, these are the consequences of her actions dont worry"" so im unsure of what to do at this point. im mentally drained and want to shut off the world for a while. they want to come to my college graduation hang out with me etc, but i dont know how that affects me moving on. possibly being the godfather of her sisters kid. i grew a bond with them, and i guess a tighter one since this happened. this caused a strain on her and her dads relationship, and her sisters. i just dont know what to do. i dont know how to properly heal, what my next course of action should be or what. could use some advice or what you guys think about what happened to me. edit: her family hates her new boyfriend and they have been pretty vocal about that, they said a narcissistic toxic person like him doesnt change. and him disrespecting not only my ex, but her family as well.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.015422077922077922,0.0008116883116883117,0.09009740259740259,2.0,0.0

(at first he said we could be friends and maybe potentially get together in the future but no promises) since i was so persistent to not break up and to resolve our issues— that’s when he denied being friends and said “no, there’s nothing now.”. i was happy the day after the break up, because i finally felt like i wasn’t tied down, nor stressed…… it wasn’t until a day ago i sent his mom a message stating we weren’t together but i still appreciate all what she’s done for me. get this— she told me she didn’t care that we split up and that she’ll always be there for me and she’ll call txt and be there for me if i needed her. that sorta made me weird, due to the fact i kept thinking if he were to move on and i were to still be apart of her life— it’ll be weird for me……..plus she told me advice on how to let go of minor stuff in an argument and to give him space for now………….was going to ask for some input. yes, i’ve been focusing on myself more and actually doing the things i put off for a while! just a question. what should i do?",breakup,1,1465.0,302.0,7.0,0.023178807947019868,0.006622516556291391,0.09933774834437085,1.0,0.0
"he love bombed me & found someone new in 3 days. to start off i met a man 3 months ago. when we met he made me feel like i was the most important human ever. showered me with attention, love, and everything i ever wanted. always knew the right things to say. on the other hand he wanted to spend every second with me, and when i would tell him i had plans it was a fight, but he would always say he got upset because he just wanted to be with me. if i didnt pick up the phone right away or answered his text i was cheating. he wanted to know my every second moves. he was jealous of my brother, and got upset when i told him i wouldnt sleep over because my brother had gotten all 4 wisdom teeth removed and i was going to take care of him during the weekend. he once told me he had prettier girls than me and then apologized, came to my house with flowers and gifts. another red flag is he purposely try to get me pregnant. well 10 days ago he got upset, because i took a plan b. told me i was a liar that i never loved him and blocked me. i spent the last 8 days trying to contact him and crying. finally spoke to him and he told me he had met someone else and had slept with her already, and they had been spending every day together. that broke my heart. i cant stop crying and hating him. i have dated other man, and been in other relationships but this has been the most painful breakup. it feels like i cant breathe. i dont know what to do, i have 3 months of amazing memories, this man filled my head with ideas of a future, kids, family, told me he would do anything for me and in less than 2 weeks met someone else. it is crazy how 3 months felt so long. he embedded in my mind that he was my soulmate. i also want to mention i did everything i could to make him happy, he wanted me every day at his apartment basically and i would spend from thursday to sunday or sunday to friday at his apartment. he also blamed me for bad things that happen to him, he said him not going to the gym a lot was my fault because i was lazy. one thing he holds against me is that he found a text from a male friend, where he asked if i would go to his birthday party, tbh knowing how jealous he was i just deleted it. and he went through my text found it on my deleted and basically for 2 months called me a cheater. i should have seen all the red flags his body count was 120. when i told him mine was 22 he told me it was impossible and that made me dirty as a female. by the way he sent me a picture of the new girl and told she me was badder than i was, and better in every way.",breakup,1,2574.0,522.0,3.0,0.005747126436781609,0.005747126436781609,0.1206896551724138,0.0,0.0

"my niece (19f) thinks she might still be in love with her ex (18f) after a dramatic breakup… does she try to be friends again? hey reddit, i’m writing this on behalf of my niece j (19f) who asked me for advice and also kinda wanted this story out there. she wrote the whole thing for me because she wasn’t sure what to do anymore. so here we go. at the end of 2023, j moved across the country and started riding at a new horse stable. within a month, she met her now best friend l. through l, she met a girl named t (18f). j and t became fast friends, hanging out at the stables and outside of it. j knew t had a girlfriend at the time and that she was also a lesbian, but nothing else happened back then. summer rolled around and things changed. they both leased horses and saw each other every single day, getting super close and eventually becoming best friends. that’s when j realized she was falling in love with t, but didn’t say anything because t still had a girlfriend and j wasn’t out yet. then over winter break, everything changed. t and her girlfriend didn’t talk at all during the two-week holiday, but j and t texted every day. t later told j she had also started falling for her during that time. in january, t and her girlfriend broke up, but t wasn’t very heartbroken — she had already been considering it. j and t had already gotten super close, and started doing “rebellious” stuff like vaping together (j's idea). it kinda became their thing. they were both in deep. in february, j came out to t and told her she liked her. t told her she liked her too. a few days later, they got into alcohol for the first time, stole some shots from t's parents, and then went to the forest with a full liter of vodka (bad idea alert 🚨). they played a drinking game, kissed a couple times, but then j hit her head and blacked out from a combo of concussion and alcohol. t had to call her mom, and they ended up calling an ambulance because j's heart literally stopped twice. it was terrifying. luckily, j woke up the next day in the hospital and went home. later that day, t met her at a playground near her house and they talked through everything — and j asked t to be her girlfriend. t said yes. from there, it was a full-on first love experience. they texted constantly, kissed, told each other everything, said “i love you” after a week, celebrated valentine’s and birthdays together, even went through all the bases (yes, all the bases 😳). they were obsessed with each other — until pony camp. at pony camp, everything went sideways. t started acting distant and weird. on the 4th day, they dyed their hair purple together, but j sent t a long message with all her worries (instead of saying it in person — she now regrets that). the next day at the pool, they got into a fight about the message and all their insecurities came up. they “reset” the relationship and agreed to start fresh… but five minutes later, t broke up with j. she just said, “i think it’s better if we break this off now.” j said “okay,” and t walked away. j had a panic attack, cried for the rest of camp, and told herself it was for the best — even though she definitely didn’t believe that. now — 3.5 months later they didn’t speak for a long time, just a quick “hi” once. but recently, they had their first real convo since the breakup. it was short and casual, but it made j realize she might still be in love with t. she doesn’t know what to do. she’d at least like to be friends again, maybe more, but she’s confused. here’s the tea: t snaps her back instantly, with full-face selfies or kinda flirty pics t still wears the necklace and bracelet j gave her t looks at her a lot in their friend group t shares some secrets with her, like they used to but j’s best friends think she’s being delusional and told her to let it go one of her friends even said they’ll ask t if she still likes j “because it looks like j still likes her.” j’s feeling hopeful but also confused and scared. so reddit, what do you think? should she try to talk to t about how she feels? try to rebuild a friendship first? or let it go and move on completely? any advice (especially from other queer teens or people who’ve been through intense first loves like this) would be super appreciated",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.009720534629404616,0.006075334143377886,0.010935601458080195,5.0,0.0
"told me he finds it difficult to be attracted to me my ""partner "" and i had a conversation two days ago, it was about the lack of being physically intimate with each other, to the point where he doesn't even kiss me anymore. i brought this up, as having less sex is one thing (3 times in six months ) but now no kissing or even hand holding. asked him why, he said he finds it hard to be attractive to me since i have put on weight. this is the second time he has said this to me. he said it the first time at the start of the year and since then i have lost 2kg. he says hes not happy, and hes only going through the motions in the relationship and that he is after loosing himself in this relationship. i comforted him and validated him because i love him deeply, he of course does not the feel the same way anymore. told me it might be good to leave the house for a week or two, it's his house, i'm currently in my mums. i never thought a person that i loved would say this to me and i thought my heart was complete safe with him. but here we are. heartbroken 💔 i dont even know what advice i'm looking for. i just want to put it out there",breakup,1,1142.0,231.0,3.0,0.012987012987012988,0.021645021645021644,0.09523809523809523,0.0,0.0
"kinda broken here, and not sure how to process or move forward. first post ever on reddit... so me a 34m, i have 3 children, 2 i'm guardian of starting 3 years ago, 11f, 15m, and my own 4f from a past relationship that the mother repeatedly cheated on me with (with a crackhead nonetheless). the ex and i broke up 2 years ago, after roughly 3 months i had rebuilt my confidence and decided to touch base with a woman i had met when i worked at a convenience store around 4 years ago. this woman i had honestly started to have feelings with back then and stepped away as even though my partner at the time wasn't faithful, i wanted to be for the sake of my child with her. fast forward to the start of my relationship with this woman, it was amazing, i really thought she was the mythical ""unicorn"" for lack of better wording. we took things slowly at first as i had insisted as i didn't want these children to feel abandoned by yet another woman in their lives. over this time, as far as i knew we had a perfect relationship. she had partially moved in over a year ago and fully moved in earlier this year. without getting into too much, my mother stayed at this house with us and was a constant issue. she moved out recently and we started looking into either buying this house off her properly or moving. i wasn't working at this time due to childcare, however i wasn't and am not a deadbeat, i did every chore, albeit the house has been in need of repairs which i wasn't able to complete at the time. well, at first my mother was going to sell us the house at a reasonable price that we would have been able to get a loan for as it wouldn't be able to pass inspection. as time went on my mother kept changing the parameters, to the point that it wasn't feasible (no bank ever would agree to the loan, especially with the needed repairs"" and made us super uneasy. during this time, we figured we would get the house, so we spent $4000 on tools and materials so i can rebuild and remodel the whole house. well with the fiancé 31f deciding she didn't want this house anymore period, that made the tools useless. we would need a 2nd income. no issue, however, i misrepresented myself horribly here. roughly 2 months ago i decided to start looking into woodworking, and using the saw mill we had to make some side income, i knew this wouldn't be a full time income to support us, however i wanted to get it started and set up. after this, if we were lucky maybe it would bring in the income we needed to not only afford the housing but allow her to quit her job. she had started getting very depressed about her job and the stresses. well, as we were financially stable for the time being, i asked her to let me work on this side business for two months, and i'll look for proper work around that time as well, so i'd have a main source of income and a side business. again, my goal was to get her away from her job, and to support everyone. well, due to how i misrepresented myself and how i explained the situation, she took from it that i didn't want to work at all, and that caused her to feel used. she expressed some things to me, but instead of venting to me about her frustrations or concerns, she vented to her single cousin 29f, and her single mother (who's been single for the better part of 20 years). so, she decided to leave one day, packed everything and left, treated me short and shallow, wouldn't let me explain myself, or try to work on the issues that miscommunication forced. i have terrible anxiety, and she asked for space, i tried to give it to her, and did a half way decent attempt. she decided today, (she left on the 18th) that she was finally willing to talk to me. and essentially told me she didn't want anything to do with me anymore and made up reasonings to elaborate on how bad i was. i don't get it, i was utterly committed to her, i believed her and trusted her when she said she would stay committed and wouldn't ever go anywhere. i had lost trust in women with my ex, and tried to hard to trust again, and ended up doing so. if she would have came to me and vented to me, i know deep down inside i would have fixed any problems... i truly loved this woman, and so did my children. i feel abandoned and thrown away. i feel like love is not enough at all, that commitment just doesn't exist in this day and age as people will leave the second they have any issue. i would have changed the world for her if only she asked. over the past 2 weeks i've spent 18-20 hours a day repairing this house (completely remodeled, dry walled, and reframed the master bedroom). my mother conceded and admitted to the stress she caused and has given me the house and even offered to cover some bills for us so we can continue repairs. i've spent time learning that ""you're not listening to me"" is not meant to be a literal statement but a metaphorical one. that she wanted me to be a dom, yet i never researched it properly and thought i knew, even though i had a hard time accepting that normal precepts that are ingrained in me as a man don't have a place in such a consenting field. i've spent hours each day listening to podcasts over the topic so i could live up to this. i've spent countless hours searching for jobs. every issue she mentioned, i have gone above and beyond to show myself as willing to fix them and change, as i know i'm always learning and ever involving. i did everything for this woman, i'd make her favorite dinners, pack her lunches, make her coffee in the mornings, go to every family event. anything she wanted to do i'd do, i showed her love in so damn many small and big ways, such as her having a particularly bad day at work, i bought her flowers, and made her favorite dinner, and then stayed by her side and tried to support her emotionally... i'm kind of broken here; i've never loved a woman like i did this time. i didn't think true love was a thing till her, not even with my ex i have a child with. these children are broken; i'm lost. i had to have a friend come over last tuesday and take my gun away from me as i wanted to leave, i couldn't accept being such a failure. i couldn't accept that i was the type of man to lose what i considered to be the best woman. i really don't know what to do here, i'm penniless with three children relying on me, they've been abandoned again. i have no support system; xanax prescription is running out. hell i'm crying like a baby while writing this, and i don't cry. i know i had issues, but i would and still sadly would fix everything for the sake of her and these kids. i just don't know if i'm even capable of taking care of them, or if they would be better off without me. why is commitment not a thing anymore, and why are people so willing to leave a good situation when they lose feelings. love is work, love is hard, and i was always told you stay committed, you only leave under toxic, or abusive situations. i was neither toxic nor was i abusive, i had plenty of issues that's for sure, but damn it i was a good man, and if there are god/s above, they know i loved her and would have worked through any issue. i sincerely don't know where to go from here, how to help these kids, or what to do anymore, she wouldn't even entertain the idea of us staying friendly so i can show her my commitment to change and

"anyone else's ex unrecognizable? so it's been about 6-months post breakup and i've been doing fairly well on my healing journey. that was until i was on instagram today and unexpectedly came across an ig story of a mutual with my ex at some random bar downtown at 3am. for context, when i was with this girl she had a very hard time going out. she'd always give me some excuse about her health or how she had to stay home and watch her pets and it was such a hassle to try and get her to come out and spend time with me, to the point where she honestly never came out with me like that. i even remember asking her to come out to the bar and club with me a couple times, but given the fact that she is autistic she would mention how that is not an environment she would choose to be in nor did she want to be around a bunch of random drunk people due to her sensory issues. i understood this and gave her the benefit of the doubt every single time. especially with her health issues, this girl would almost feint walking up the 4-5 steps leading to the front door of my house. now? i see she's going out almost every weekend, is staying out late in the city (she'd always go to sleep at 11pm) and is even staying at hotels and airbnb's (couldn't even get this girl to stay one night with me at my university house), is dressing more confidently (good for her and nothing wrong with that - just different, that's all), it looks like she's drinking now, walking the streets for long periods of time without her mobility aids, and is in environments that have proven to be of major difficulty and issue in the past. all of the behaviour she is engaging in now she has expressed to me in the past she was very against and had no desire to take part in. so what gives? the girl i know would never think to do these kinds of things, but yet here she is doing the very things the said she never wanted to do, and would always turn down whenever i had asked her to do them with me. she is completely and utterly unrecognizable from the woman i knew during our relationship. can anyone else relate? has anyone else been through this before? is there a reason behind this kind of behaviour?",breakup,1,2179.0,419.0,4.0,0.00954653937947494,0.00477326968973747,0.0477326968973747,5.0,0.0
"how do you move on from your first relationship and serious one. hi, recently me and my boyfriend of 4 years broke up (i’m crying writing this). we were each others first everything. i took the break up pretty hard. he said he cried and did what he needed to do in 3 days. apart of me feels like 4 years meant nothing to him. i know it’s just time, but it’s time that i choose to love him. it’s time we choose to fight long distance and military relationship stereotypes. the break up hurt. i was emotional and not myself. i said something’s i didn’t mean and feel horrible about them. we argued for the last time and we are no longer in each other’s lives. we argued because i tried to fight for a relationship he didn’t care for anymore. i started opening up to a friend about our relationship. for 3.5 weeks i was holding it to myself but i felt like there was no point anymore. it was over and we were never going to see each other again. i wonder how he talks about me to other people now. i wonder if he says i was a horrible person and girlfriend. i realized through out our relationship he was an avoidant and i had anxious attachment. it was difficult at times but we made it work. after our last argument i started asking myself if he ever loved me. was i too much? why was it so easy for him to let go of me? why was i so easily disposable? why was it so easy for him to hurt me and do the things he did to me. even after everything that happened i still love him. i’m upset and hurt. i want him to be okay. i want him to be happy even if it hurts it’s not with me. how do i move on from someone i saw my future with. i am physically repulsed by the idea of someone else touching me the way he did. 4 years with someone who you’ve cried with, opened up with and felt most like your self with gone. how do you forget. how do you move on. how long until i feel okay again. why couldn’t i move on in 3 days. i would really appreciate some help.",breakup,1,1952.0,400.0,5.0,0.0125,-0.005,0.125,3.0,0.0

"i deserve to be heard, i need to be seen, i didnt get the closure i need. and its breaking me my girlfriend left me last friday, it felt so fast, so abrupt, out of the blue, so random, well at least on my end. but it is clear now that she had been moving on months ago. i just refused to acknowledge the changes thinking its one of those phases we always get through. i am filled with regrets, hurt, anxiety, and doubt. she was my partner. a year ago i was giving up because i felt like i could not be with someone who could lie to me. she refused to give up and i gave her another chance. the consequence of that was, from that point i treated her like shit. unintentionally, but because my feelings were not there anymore, i was only providing the bare minimum for us and for a year it felt so stagnant for the both of us. the breaking point was when she was demanding all of the things she needs from me and i just couldnt keep up with it given that i dont feel enough for her. but, last week, i mustered up the courage to ignite our feelings again and i planned for our anniversary. it turns out she forgot this date. that's how damaged our relationship was already. truly broken in every aspect. she felt bad and made it up for us. we ""celebrated"" in another day but after that it was just a mess of arguments rooting form our frustrations that we dont love each other like we did before. we made up like we used to, i thought it was gonna be fine, until i received her message of letting me go as her final act of love. i have never felt pain like this before. she did not give me a chance to say may piece before leaving. i feel as if a blackhole consumed my soul never to return again. i need her to know how much it hurts, how much im suffering, i wouldnt wish this to anyone. this is beyond what i can handle and i cannot function. i cannot sleep, cannot eat, i cannot do anything. reasons why it got fucked up \- i couldnt forgive her for the fact she wronged me and in return i treated her like absolute shit, so ofc she lost her feelings and for the past few months she wasnt loving me anymore, at least truthfully, her heart wasnt there anymore, she cried because of familiarity, for comfort, she felt bad, she was guilty, she did not love me anymore, she was there only because she felt bad for me, i can take the blame too, i am accountable, i had my faults, this was fucked from the beginging, insecurity, games from the beginning fucked this up, true love is scary, i have to let her go. \- this does not deteriorate my value, a failed relatioship will not define me, it doesnt make me any less of a man, i am not my mistakes if i learn from them, i should have loved her more, should have been more understanding. if truly loved her i would have done more. there was no more initiative from me. the only reason why im so hurt right now is because it was so sudden. it was like lightning, at least on my end. but there were too many signs that this was coming. i just chose to ignore it. everything reminds me of her, but thats only because i told her everything that runs on my mind on a daily basis.i made her my journal, i was at my most vulnerable, without knowing that she was already moving on for months. it was obvious that something changed, but in my head, i thought it was just one of those phases that we can push through together, i did not know that this was the final chapter already. thats why it hurts. i am naive, stupid even, for thinking someone could be with me while i treat them like shit. all the random women that ive been talking to cannot fill the void, i know it myself. i even feel guilty for reaching out. they are not the answer but they distract me for a moment or two and for me thats enough peace. i cannot sleep, cannot be awake, i just wish my ex and i never met from the beginning. its in the past already, but it hurts insanely. every movie,series,game,experience, i wish to share with her still. but i know that its gone. i feel like im in a blackhole stuck in my own mind. like that claustrophobic end scene in interstellar, fucks me up that we just watched that in imax. in a way, her last message tells me everything, everything that there is to know from her side. and for that i am thankful, i just have to navigate through the world now without her. which is like asking a pirate to go to the endless sea without the stars. i am in absolute disarray. work does not feel like anything anymore",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,5.0,0.0057405281285878304,0.002296211251435132,0.11940298507462686,0.0,0.0

"could use a outside perspective, if you have the time. i dont know to feel about this and could use someone else's perspective. hey reddit, i’m just looking for an outside perspective on something that’s been sitting heavy with me. my ex and i officially broke up in january, but we stayed on-and-off until the end of may/early june. our relationship was toxic — i won’t sugarcoat that. i was in a bad place mentally, emotionally burnt out, and not the partner i should’ve been. at the same time, she was drinking heavily, partying a lot, and eventually got into drugs like cocaine. i'm not trying to villainize her to feel better about myself — i know i contributed to the toxicity just as much. i just want to give full context. we lived together for almost two years. i even moved my china cabinet into her apartment. after we broke up, i asked for it back, and she refused. we were still talking, but i could feel something was off between us. despite everything, i told her i wanted to marry her one day — to grow old together. i asked her for clarity, and she admitted she couldn’t commit, that she had issues of her own to work through, but that she still wanted the same things… just not right now. shortly after, i filed a petition with the court to get my china cabinet back. but honestly? it wasn’t about the furniture. i was hurt, and i was lashing out. i realized that, canceled the petition, and sent her a message apologizing. i told her she deserved better — someone who wouldn’t try to be manipulative or retaliatory the way i had been. that was early june. we haven’t talked since. fast forward to now: my grandfather recently passed away. she found out somehow and called me out of the blue. she said she was sorry for my loss, told me she was praying for me, and asked if i wanted her to come to the funeral. i’m not expecting to get back together. i’m not even sure what i’d want if she did reach out again. i’ve been doing my best to focus on my future — i got a new job and have been actively in the process of joining the air force, which i was working on even while we were together. still, her call shook me. i’m trying not to overthink it, but i’m confused about what it meant and how i should even mentally frame it. was it closure? guilt? kindness? something else? i’m not asking if we should get back together — i’m just looking for honest, outside thoughts on this whole situation.",breakup,1,2412.0,465.0,3.0,0.0064516129032258064,0.0,0.11612903225806452,5.0,0.0

"do not give or seek access after break-up hello, reddit here to vent share my opinion about no-contact and why zero access helps healing. i (30f) was dating a man (30m) for a year. the relationship ended 1 month back, and i am sitting down to share what i have been learning about no-contact and no-access. i was dumped over text without any context or a clean break-up, and i had to self-soothe and accept what happened. hence what you see below is from my pov. **pre-breakup context:** my ex and i had a bitter-sweet relationship. he came in my life when i really needed someone to lean on, and i believe he too needed someone. it started off intensely: he found ""the one"" in me after the first date, left his job immediately, moved in with me in the 2nd month with a promise to study and get a better job, smoked up weed every day instead of studying, finally i helped him get a job in my domain and carried his financial and emotional load for 6 months. in the meantime i had started asking him to study but he did not - leading to a few verbal fights. one of these times he was threatening me that he will leave my own apartment, and i, instead of saying ""please don't leave me"", told ""sure please leave, let me know if you would need help to book your tickets."" because he did not have money. that day he slammed his fist against against the wall. and after 3 months, he blamed me for not apologising to him when he slammed his fist... i was shocked. all these while, his mom was almost getting us married (he never proposed nor did i say yes). long story short, as all of you may know, it ended how it was supposed to end. i chased this man for another 6 months, trying to explain myself and how i was hurting. he being well read and with his promises of lifelong love, i felt he will have the tools to cope better and understand that i have only good intentions for him. but one day he told me that i am a nagging sour girl with an unwise dream to do a phd - i had asked him if he can give me some clarity. he never tried to apologize and had shut me down saying i am difficult to live with. i quietly left. this time, no explanation, no begging, not fight, no chaos. **post break-up context:** i felt an immediate shift in power when i did not react to his childish tantrums. i work 10 hours a day, earn fairly enough to sustain myself, my parents, my pet, and my hobbies. and i realized that my worth is not tied to how this man or no one perceives me. but i still had the need to be seen by him - so i did not block him in instagram. but just the next day after the break-up, i see him posting a rage-bait saying ""a job is so difficult. anyone with their head in their ass will think everything is fine."" well i know this was a ragebait because i did tell him to get a job that pays well and is not a temporary gig. he also posted something like ""going back to my bois after the love that felt like ""i will marry her"" ended lol"". that's when it struck me that i am letting him mess up with my head. **so what did my therapist suggest:** first of all, my therapist wanted us to have a dignified break-up with proper closure because he has always been ""a good guy with bad issues"" in my story. i think any person, who is good or bad in our story deserves a clean break-up (including myself). but since it did not happen, she says: 1. the moment anyone decides that to leave a relationship, and if you were not abusive (did not namecall / hit them / scream at them / anything that is categorized under abuse), their access to our life is over. it does not matter if they apologize today or if they will apologize after 6 months. **reason:** contact gives an impression that i can be accessed periodically on their whims and fancy. you may think its goodwill/old times sake. but it really is lack of our self respect which is = ex thinking ""i do not have to respect her more than how much she respects herself"". lol never. 2. they do not get to see what we are doing in life, if we are on holidays, if we are partying, if we are crying, if we are married, have kids, because they chose to leave your life knowing that they will lose this access. i know we want them to see us and feel they lost something valuable. but it does not matter. **reason:** why should we centralize our life around them seeing us happy? yes, it messes up their head, but trust me it messes up our heads too. we are not as strong and detached as we would like us to believe (this post won't have happened if i were that detached.) 3. you do not get to see what happens to their lives because they too are playing the same game **reason:** access in social media = visibility without context = a false sense of control. you may think ""oh, they are doing great and maybe i missed the boat."" but look at your social media.. its just a photo album, and we always said ""cheese"". it means nothing most of the times. 4. if they ever apologize? leave them with the void, man. **reason:** hardly any second-chance work. if it works, great. but think if they decide to work on themselves by putting you out of their story instead of trying to be better and do the work with you - then is this not abandonment? is this something guranteed they will not do again? 5. this can more difficult but most crucial: the person who left, left for some reason. is this not the time to do self-check-in a bit? **reason:** when you have a wound, would you scratch to heal or would you leave it alone with medicines? here time and therapy are my medicines. we all make mistakes in a relationship. we are also hurt enormously by our partners. two truths - that you are hurt by someone and that you made mistakes too - can live simultaneously. instead of focusing on ""why they hurt me?"", is this not an opportunity to shift focus on ""why we do what we do?"". access gives us too many stimuli to keep reacting (whether we break no contact or not technically, we still think about them, try to control the situation in our head by making make-shift theories). we are humans for god's sake. so limited to zero access gives the needed time to be objective, it allows the wound to recover. and it allows us to get our identity back - free from how much we wanted them to perceive us as worthy of love - but just a human who can learn and provide a better form of love. let me know how you have coped with breakups. and some wisdom that your therapists may provide you with. :)",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.027597402597402596,0.008116883116883116,0.08279220779220779,5.0,0.0

"should i give up on my ex? sorry for the long story so me (19f) and my ex(20m) were long distance for a year and he just moved in with me here in april. he broke up with me this june, we’ve had a rocky relationship mainly because of the distance and the fact we are both young. he didn’t grow up around love and rarely received it we have a pretty good relationship we have our issues but our goods outweighs our bads tremendously. when he moved here i started to feel an emotional withdrawal which was weird because at the beginning of the year one of his goals was to understand me and my emotions better which he did he was amazing if i had a problem instead of fighting with me he’d guide me through it then reassure me after so just all around a really great guy so i didn’t understand where the emotional withdrawal was coming from. when he moved in i didn’t notice that i had started to become a problem i’d bring up problems in problematic ways then tell him he doesn’t love me anymore when he’d snap example if he stayed on the game too long (8+ hours) instead of addressing it to him when it happened i’d hold it in then explode on him over something small but really it was about the problem i held in i didn’t notice i was doing this until he broke up with me. i was so devastated because we had through hell and back together and this is what causes us to end? but he explained to me and i took time and reflected and genuinely apologized but he didn’t want to get back together i basically begged him for 3 days because he’s the first guy i’ve fallen inlove with in the first guy i’ve given my body to. he got back with me saying he didn’t really want to leave he was just overwhelmed with emotions and i thought everything was fine because if i knew i was hurting my partner i would’ve stopped but i didn’t find out what i was doing wrong till after we broke up. when we got back together i sort of had this gut feeling that we weren’t ok so a couple days past and i finally asked him “how are you?” “are we ok?” and that night he came home from work and broke up with me again saying he’s been questioning if he really loved me or not and that he wants a change in his life basically saying he’s fell out of love with me and he was just holding on until he couldn’t anymore. i was heartbroken. i stopped talking to him and packed his things the next day he’s been sleeping in the living room since and i’ve been losing my mind day by day because i still want him i still love him and i still care for him. after a couple days of calming down i invited him in the bedroom to watch a movie and obviously we talked about it because i still wanted him and he told me during the talk that he needs to figure himself out and he doesn’t want to hurt me in the process because hurting me hurts him. he still loves and cares for me which makes it hurt 10x worse i left it alone for a couple more days and last night was my breaking point i texted him explaining how i don’t want to be annoying but how he choose me when i was a horrible partner and now that i’m a good partner he’d rather leave. his response was “ because i am a monster i’ve had this conversation in my head a lot and nothing i come up with seems like enough. but that day it rained in your room i saw myself for the first time how i’ve been hurting people. how i say i want connection but then i pull away. how i keep showing up with this hunger for love, and then second-guessing it the second i have it. how i leave confusion behind every time i go you keep asking me why? how do you just stop loving me? did you ever? and it’s throws me for a loop everytime because no matter what i say i can’t even trust my own answer i mean well but i can’t do well” my response to this message was “ i feel sick to my stomach. i’m so angry wit you to the point where i don’t even want to cry i just feel devastated, you say you wanna figure yourself out but you’re choosing to run away it’s not “noble” you’re literally just being a coward. i never needed you to be perfect or to never hurt me i just need you to choose me. do you honestly think i haven’t had second thoughts about you or our love? well i did and i told you i did because i didn’t want to run from them i wanted to face the facts and accept them so i could continue love you but i’m just so angry because why did you have to move in with me and then do this” and his final reply to me was “ i’m not proud of that. it disgusts me, actually. and what scares me more than anything is that this isn’t new, i thought i would be fine and okay and i promised myself it wouldn’t happen again. but it did. and it happened with you. you, who were steady, who looked at me like i was worth something. and somehow, that made it hurt even more. because i knew i couldn’t keep doing this to you. i am the thing i’ve been scared of being i take and doubt. i hope and retreat. i say “i care” and then disappear into my own head i don’t think it’s noble to leave this isn’t noble. it’s not clean. it’s not brave. it’s fear. it’s damage control. it’s me trying to stop the bleeding before i start pretending i’m not the one holding the knife. i cried in front of you because that was the moment i realized i couldn’t keep lying. that i’m not steady. i’m not grounded. i’m not someone who can love without slowly poisoning it with all the shit i still haven’t figured out in myself. i wanted to believe that being vulnerable was enough. that the crying meant change. that being seen meant i was ready. but i wasn’t and i’m not and that scares me” i love him dearly and don’t want to give up on him because my heart choose him. but i don’t want to be pushy so half of me just wants to let him go. he struggles with anxiety and imposter syndrome so much so it also makes me hesitant i love him and i want him but i need him to want me to i’m sure we can make it work but i just don’t know",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.0104,0.0072,0.1312,5.0,0.0

"my ex is a completely different person now it's been about 3 to 4 years since we broke up from a 9-year relationship and i can't even recognize him. all the things that he used to hate and make fun of before he's turned into. he was a gym rat that was religious hardcore into the right wing demographic and voted for trump. now, he's always been the kind of type who would kind of change and act differently in front of other people. but not to this extent, the person he is now is entirely different on really fundamental things. he goes to gay pride parades dresses flamboyantly wears sun hats. he is about 200 lb heavier and listens to pop hits and country. he only listened to metal before and country music was something that he used to make fun of before, he'd shut the radio off in my car if it was ever on. he is a staunch atheist now and seems to be afraid of the sun. he used to work shirtless in the yard and now he has all kinds of stuff covering the sun from him, big hats and umbrellas. i really don't understand how someone can change so many things that seem fundamental to him before. i feel like the old him would have beaten up the new him lol. i've totally moved on but it was a bit alarming to see just how different a person can be. i've known him since he was 14 and the kind of person he is now is the kind of person he would have made fun of in the past for sure. towwards the end of our relationship i realized that maybe he was a bit of a psychopath, especially towards the end when i learned a lot of truth about him and a lot of the lies came out. he manipulated so many for selfish reasons so i'm almost certain this is another kind of manipulation really. i'm just curious if anyone else has seen this drastic of a change in someone?",breakup,1,1764.0,344.0,2.0,0.005813953488372093,0.014534883720930232,0.02616279069767442,1.0,0.0

"wife (30) of 4 years (8 together) cheated on me (35) with her male work colleague (50) apologies in advance for a long one. i recently found out that my wife of 4 years, together for 8 years, has been (emotionally) cheating on me with an older work colleague since christmas, which became physical in may this year. she told me that since last summer, she felt her feelings towards me wane, and that she no longer saw me romantically, but more as a blood relative. one of the reasons she put this down to was a lack of intimacy, sex and passion (mostly from my part). she also said she no longer saw me as man and that i was lacking ambition, mostly regarding my career. in my head, i think (possibly a big) part of the reason why this gradually started happening since last summer was due to multiple external factors (as well as internal ones within the relationship). last summer we bought out first house together, and were moving house for those months. the house also needs a lot of work done to it, which was causing us stress. in october, i was applying for a promotion, when suddenly my work declared they were in a massive deficit and job cuts were inevitable, as was a massive downsize all around. this still hasn't been fully resolved, and while i still have a job there, so much is uncertain. it is also frustrating that i missed the job opportunity, but that's life - i think this played a big role in her seeing me as less of a man, because i wasn't looking for other jobs and promotions and i was set in my ways in my hybrid job. she felt she was the breadwinner and the one wearing the trousers. and i put my career aside so she could focus on hers, as i knew this was important to her. it's not that i gave up on improving myself, but i saw it as more of a hiatus for her to prioritise her career. she also felt i let myself go in terms of hygiene (mostly because i get gas due to stomach issues, and apparently i burped in her face during intercourse once - i genuinely don't remember doing that, but will take her word for it). then, at christmas her family cat died around about the same time her mum found out she has cancer (currently being treated). in february this year, my family dog died and around the same time my wife ended up in a&e with extreme back pain, which we later discovered was due to herniated disks in her lower spine (something still causing issues). this was also a big reason for the lack of intimacy, and i saw her as fragile, due to the amount of pain she was in. we are separated now, after i recently discovered she cheated - which she finally admitted and broke down for me (i'm aware this is her account of things, and i should take this with a pinch of salt, as she is a liar). she said she noticed this older man since last christmas, and he gave her butterflies, something which no man had done since she was a teenager (which was a kick in the teeth for me, knowing she didn't feel that way about me), and since february she actively started pursuing him, finding excuses to speak to him and get to know him. eventually they started talking, she gave him her number and they went for coffee, where she admitted she was married, but confessed her feelings about him and lack of feelings towards me. this then blossomed. originally i became aware of her feelings towards him back in april, when i could sense distance growing between us, but she said she was confused (something she still says, even now). she seems him romantically and with interest, but me with love because of our history (not sexually). i initially offered couples therapy, even up until the end (when she finally admitted it got physical), but she always refused and admitted herself she had given up on our relationship. she said a reason for this is because she had suggested therapy in the past to discuss our issues, by which she was referring to me, but ai refused. she said i was a ""mommy's boy"", because i take care of my mum and she felt i always prioritised my mum (and my other family members) before her - which i disagree with, as i feel i prioritise my family in general, of which she was a part of - but that's her views. in may, our relationship came to a slow death when i caught her lying about spending the night away with him. she said she was with her friend, but had in fact went away for a romantic night in a different city with him, staying overnight. when she got caught, she insisted it had only been kissing and that they stayed in a hostel. which deep down i knew was rubbish, but a part of me wanted to believe her. she also got upset at me for spying on her. i left our house, went back to my mum's to get some space. my family found out and obviously their views towards her changed. this upset my wife and i think brought the relationship even further to the point of no return. i also said some things in anger, but eventually apologised (for what i said) once i calmed down. i accept that the relationship is dead, and what we once had is now lost, but i can't help the feeling of the rug being pulled from under my feet. before all this, we were finally getting ready to plan for children (which she said she always wanted with me), and though i'm glad there are no kids involved, as this would be so much harder, i feel frustrated (mostly at myself for my failings in the relationship, as i'm aware it takes two -

i plan to contest this eventually, as we co-own it), the imagined family i was planning for and the fact i am back living at my mum's, which just makes me feel like such a loser. i'm also frustrated and feel my situation makes me seem less desirable when the time comes and when i feel ready to move on to a new relationship, which admittedly isn't now and i know situations change. i'm also so confused, because all of the things she's done: cheating, being with an older man and with someone who has family tona previous marriage or partner, are all things she was totally against in the past. she also made me feel bad about having female friends, often got jealous and would say things to me about how many other men noticed her, were eyeing her up etc. i'm aware this comes from her own insecurities, but can't help but feel odd about her actions, since they show me a different woman from the one i married. i guess this is mostly a vent, but im also looking for ways to help cope. i'm considering therapy, but will need to save up for a few sessions as this isn't cheap. i'm not suicidal or anything, just severely deflated. i should also point out all communication has stopped, except for the essentials, like legal matters and the house.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.006191950464396285,-0.0046439628482972135,0.08513931888544891,0.0,0.0

"met up with my ex, please help hi guys, i came here because i need strangers perception in this story. so back when i was 19 i started dating jake. jake was amazing guy and we were so in love. i met his family, he met mine. i adored his sisters and would always hang out with them and his mother. they were such an amazing family to be around and i was always so grateful. we were together for 3 years. one day he just stopped responding to my texts. i was confused. later that night i called him and he declined my call. then his oldest sister texted me saying to never talk to them again, i should stop contacting jake. i was so confused and asked her what was going on. she told me to stop acting dub and called me a whre. i was genuinly so confused because i had no idea what was going on. next month was terrible because his almost entire friend group would text me these disgusting messages calling me names. it was steaight up ab*se. i didn't want to leave the house, i was in a horrible place mentally. after a month it finally stopped. few months after his bestfriend texted me to meet up. at first i did not want to but then he called and told me he just wants to give me closure because he doesn't think i deserve all of this. so i met up with him. and basically what happend is that someone told my boyfriend they've seen me making out with some other dude in the club and then went with him and never came back. i was shocked, because everyone knew i never went clubbing. i started bawling my eyes and his friend just hugged me and said he knows i didn't do it and thats why he needed to tell me why everything went down. he told me he tried talking some sense into my boyfriend but he wouldn't listen. he was the one that made all the other friends stop texting me. i asked him who spread that story he said he had no idea and that my boyfriend never told him. he also told me my boyfriend is horrible not eating, not leaving the house. he wanted to set up a meeting without my boyfriend knowing i would be there but i refused. we said our goodbyes. that all happend 3 years sgo and i haven't heard from any of them because we live in big city. the truth is i never got over him or us. i still love him to this very day. i miss him so much my heart aches everytime i think about him. last week he started following me on instagram. few minutes after i got a text from him asking me to talk. i agreed. i haven't thought about it for a second. we met up day after and he started bawling as soon as he saw me. he then hugged me and started apologizing. we sat and he proceeded to tell me story how it all started. basically his older sisters friend was always in love with him and none of them had idea about it. she was in their lives since they were kids so when she came one day telling him she saw me making out with a dude and leaving with him all of them believed her. a month ago she accidently reavealed the truth. he was telling his sisters how he started talking to this one girl and the friend looked pissed and straight up said:""well i didn't separate you from your ex so you can be with another girl"". he said his heart started hurting so bad the moment she said that. his sisters were pissed. he had a panic attack and ended up in er. when he told me that i was pissed but also kinda relieved. he asked to get back together beacuse after all these years he still loves me and has never stopped loving me. i told him i also never stopped loving him but i dont think this relationship has any future. because how awkward would it be to meet up with his sisters and friends after all those nasty messages. not just that, but the fact he believed that friend without even having a chat with me hurt me a lot. he didn't even give me a chance to explain and talk to him. i told him the first few days were so confusing because i was getting such a terrible texts and for something i didn't even know ""happend"". he told me he doesn't think it would be awkward because his mom never stopped talking about me or how much she misses me and his sister also have deep regrets and would like to apologize to me. he then said to think for few days and we will meet up again. after that i got messages apologizing from all his friends and sisters. but the thing is i really dont want to get back together with him. i do, but i don't. i cant explain it i dont think that would be a good decision for me. i told this to my friends and they are rooting for us to get back together and my gut is telling me no. so i needed some other perspective. i know this is long but i hope someone atleast reades all and helps me",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.008714596949891068,0.004357298474945534,0.11655773420479303,0.0,0.0

"3-year relationship on pause for 8 months – i'm focusing on healing, but still unsure what to do i’m a 26-year-old male, and i’ve been in a relationship for 3 years with a 27-year-old woman who means a lot to me. about 8 months ago, she said “yes” when i asked her about marriage, but since then, communication has drastically reduced. i’ve made mistakes, i’ve grown from them, and i’ve tried to support her silently—but i now find myself in a space where i’m not sure what direction to take emotionally. this is not about judging anyone. i’m not here to ask if i’m right or wrong. i just want advice from people who’ve experienced similar uncertainty, growth, or silent endings. --- ### **our story (briefly):** * we met in college, became friends, and started dating seriously 3 years ago. * she had to drop out of college due to family issues, but i encouraged her to pursue her degree later, which she’s trying to do now. * she’s deeply spiritual, responsible toward her family, and prefers doing things on her own. i admire that. * i suggested she resign from a tiring job and focus fully on her studies. she moved back to her native village to prepare and help at home. * her phone is shared with her mother, and she's often surrounded by relatives, which limits her ability to call or message freely. --- ### **what’s happening now:** * for the last 8 months, communication has been minimal—usually one message a month from her saying something like *“you understand me, i’m sorry.”* * she doesn’t reply to my messages or calls. i message only occasionally, never in a pushy way. * she is spiritually involved (once said she’s reading *shiv charitra*) and hasn't told me clearly what's going on emotionally. * she still changes her whatsapp dp regularly, which confuses me because she doesn’t respond to anything i share—like job links or support material. --- ### **my past mistakes (which i acknowledge):** * i struggled with alcohol. it affected our calls and how i showed up for her emotionally. * during one of my government exams, i ignored her calls, especially during a trip to pune when i was out with friends and drinking. * i was drunk the night she said “yes” to marriage. * i removed her from a website project due to delays—something i should’ve handled better. * she once asked for a spiritual ritual (havan) in her name, which i didn’t take seriously at the time. these are things i regret, and i’ve taken real steps to improve. --- ### **what i’m doing now:** * i’m **cutting down drinking**, joined the **gym**, and am **preparing seriously for government exams** (civil engineering). * i’m trying to build stability—emotionally, financially, and mentally. * i’ve often deleted her contact to move on, but i still sometimes send her things that might help her career. * i’ve thought about visiting her native place (where i used to work as a pe), not to confront her, but to gain clarity—for both of us. --- ### **what i’m looking for:** i’m not asking “am i right or wrong?”—i know where i failed, and i’ve been working on myself. instead, i’m looking for perspective from people who have: * gone through long phases of silence in a serious relationship. * held on silently, wondering whether to keep hope or move forward. * balanced love with self-respect while healing.",breakup,1,3297.0,579.0,1.0,0.0017271157167530224,0.008635578583765112,0.09153713298791019,1.0,0.0

"breakup of a good, healthy relationship he was so sweet to me, i don’t think i’ve felt more emotionally safe with anyone. there wasn’t one bad memory i had with him. we had been dating for five months before very suddenly learning he had to travel/move away for most of the next year for work. he’s really passionate about his career path. i’m not sure how to move on from this. it’s just pure sadness. i feel so defeated to finally find someone who can be sooo good in so many aspects, and neither of us want to leave each other. but he doesn’t feel like he can give enough attention to a relationship with his work. then after that, there’s a good chance i could be moving away. i can’t be mad at him, i can’t say, “i can find better” because he was the better, i can’t blame anyone. i don’t know how i’m supposed to move on and “get over” that. i will not be able to change the fact that i’d take him back any day. hope the next person can deal with that fact??… i can’t hope anything will change because it won’t. losing a good ass person is so much harder. it doesn’t make sense, it doesn’t feel right. there’s no lesson to be learned. the dating pool is terrible and it’s highly unlikely for me to find anyone who is that good anytime soon (i was single and dating around for 3 solid years prior with so many first dates. i know what’s around. if i told you about every single one that didn’t work out, you’d agree and say i don’t deserve their kind of treatment). if i don’t somehow win the lottery again in the near future, i’m going to be so damn depressed dating shitty man after shitty man and men that are just not a good match for me and repetitively rolling the dice with so little hope. it’s distracting but it is not fulfilling. more stressful and dramatic than anything. but i eventually will have to, because i know what i want and it isn’t being single for life. i was just really happy. this fucking sucks.",breakup,1,1926.0,397.0,3.0,0.007556675062972292,0.03526448362720403,0.07556675062972293,2.0,0.0

"my (24m) ex-girlfriend (23f) broke up with me and then reached out the next week to tell me she regrets it. how do i move forward? two weeks ago, my girlfriend broke up with me. this was the culmination of a rough patch we’ve been having, one that started because she had started feeling insecure and fearing that i don’t really love her. we were together for over 3 years and i absolutely adored and loved this woman. we have envisioned a future together and everything. we were actually in the process of moving in. she kind of just panicked one day and started feeling this way, and for weeks i reassured her and we’d seemingly progress, only for it to crumble again. two weeks ago, she had a breakdown and broke up with me. it was brutal. i spent a week completely heartbroken and completely sick. these few weeks were really tough on me mentally, as it felt like i was starting to be convinced that i didn’t treat her as kindly as i thought. a week later, she called me and told me how much she regrets it. how she spent a lot of time reflecting and she had realized this came from a place of fear, and how she’s so regretful and ashamed for self-sabotaging. she acknowledged that i treated her really well and that she’s sorry for everything that happened. she really emphasized how sorry she was. she extended an olive branch and said that if i think there’s something worth saving, that she’s willing. i struggled to say anything over call because i was crying so hard. i had been grieving something else for a week. this was a lot on my nervous system. all i was able to say was that i need some time to respond, and she assured me that’s completely fine. she assured me that she’ll be here when i reach out. it’s been a week since, and though i haven’t entirely decided what i want to do, i’m leaning towards trying to work things through. she is somebody i love more than life itself. this was also genuinely, like, the only “rough patch” we’ve ever had. she’s a generally insecure person and it comes out in bad ways sometimes, but i guess i just never imagined this would happen. it’s been a difficult two weeks because i honestly believed we were never talking again at first, and then that changed, so it’s been a bit jarring. i want to work things through but i don’t know if i’ll ever feel safe with her again. i don’t want to hold this mistake over her head, especially because this is the only time she’s ever let her insecurities affect our relationship like this, but i’m also trying to look for myself here, because i want to be in a relationship i feel secure in. these past two weeks have been so brutal. i recognize these things need time, and that trust needs to be rebuilt. i’m gonna sit on it for a few more days and then reach out and talk to her. this has been a really difficult time, and i just want to make sure i’m not acting rashly—based on emotions. i want to sleep on it and wake up feeling the same way for days before concluding. i would appreciate any kind of advice. literally any.",breakup,1,3022.0,593.0,5.0,0.008431703204047217,0.011804384485666104,0.09443507588532883,1.0,0.0

"shorter relationship, different pain i had a relationship that started 6 years ago, we were together for 3y, then we broke up. that breakup was absolutely devastating. we had just moved in together, and she cheated on me. i was wondering why it happened, what happened, what did i do wrong, what should i have done better. all the things. i cried every night for a month. i have never felt so much emotional pain. i had no friends to help, i was alone and sad. over the next 3 years though, i made some very close friends, started hanging out with people, and after about 2 years i was pretty much back on it. i still thought about it sometimes, but not in a way that hurt. in hindsight she was mean, toxic, and the love hadn't been there for 6 months. i got better, improved my life, and figured out who i am and what i like. then earlier this year i met a girl. we sort of hit it off and things were going really well. i was honestly afraid and stressed about having to open up and learn about someone all over again, but she made it easy. we went on a few dates, officially started dating, and i thought it was going really really well! recently she had to travel overseas for work. she got distant, our conversations became brief or one-sided, and when she got back, it was like she’d already emotionally checked out. we had a conversation about it and we cordially decided to break it off after only a few months. her reasoning boils down to 1) we just didn't communicate the same way and 2) i just wasn't quite as confident as she wanted. to clarify, i absolutely do not blame her, we left on a very good note and i sort of agree. i think we were willing to work on point 1 but 2 was a deal-breaker for her. she didn't want to hope i would change, and didn't want to ask me to change - which i deeply respect. this relationship was an order of magnitude shorter than the previous one, years compared to months, and i only cried for maybe an hour total. however, this one hurts so much *different* than the first breakup. i think it hurts so much different because the person she described that she wanted is exactly who i want to be, and there is nobody to blame but myself for that. i think i am a good person, but i have always been non-confrontational and overthink every word i say. i have never liked that about myself though. her reasoning is perfectly valid, but it hurts so much because i feel like i barely even got to know her and i fucked it up. i feel like i lost my chance at what truly could have been a great relationship because i communicate like a robot, and i boil things up before releasing them - always waiting for the right time that never comes. i instinctively treated everything too seriously - like it was a job sometimes - and i deeply regret that and wish that wasn't who i was. now i'm not sure what to do. i want to use this as a catalyst to become that person, but i'm afraid i'm just doing it because that is what she wants. i have not liked that about myself for a long time, so i don't think that is the case, but i can't tell. i also would love a second chance in a month, 2 months, 6 months maybe, but that is probably a bad mindset to have (and i'm sure i will grow out of it). and what if i get in another relationship, will they feel the same way? getting to know me, realizing that is how i am, and leaving? in the end, i feel like i fucked up something that could have been truly great with an understanding, kind, intelligent person because of a personal flaw that i have always hated with no chance at redemption. sort of shouting this into the void just to write it all out and understand it myself. i'm not sad, not mad, just frustrated that i'm not the person i want to be.",breakup,1,3726.0,687.0,7.5,0.011235955056179775,-0.0014044943820224719,0.09691011235955056,2.0,0.0
"i was thinking about my breakup today. it's been 4 months since me and my ex ended the relationship. we were together for 3 years and lived together for pretty much all of it. i believe she had undiagnosed bpd, or at the very least displayed all signs and symptoms of it. i have depression and have most of my life. mental illness isn't super important here, besides bpd making relationships very intense, along with my depression. the highs are unthinkably high and the lows are absolutely crushing. i thought by 4 months i would at least be feeling a little better, but it's a different, more deep ache that pulls me down regularly. i have been really struggling this whole month with it and i came up with a metaphor i wonder if other people could relate with. i feel like my neurons or synapses and whatnot are no longer powered nor is there anything to process. it's like my favorite restaurant that lost electricity and ran out of produce, ingredients, meat etc with zero orders being shipped to it anymore. all of the equipment is in working order, ready to be used to make amazing meals. it used to be a great restaurant full of happy customers, great reviews, people making reservations. now abandoned due to the inability to run. stuck in time. i liken it to how i feel, or lack thereof. there's no more humor (happy customers) in my life, no joy (great reviews), no point of them even being a physical presence in my brain (reservations). i know this isn't a perfect metaphor, but it's how i've been feeling a lot lately. anyway, i just wanted to type it out and hope anyone else dealing with things like this will get their power and ingredients back some day. thanks for reading",breakup,1,1691.0,303.0,6.0,0.019801980198019802,0.013201320132013201,0.07920792079207921,0.0,0.0

"i lost the love of my life because his family believed a married man who was secretly in love with me so i had this very sweet, loving, caring boy. he had the purest, truest love for me. when i touched him, i could feel his heart almost exploding from how fast it was beating. we were together for 10 months. i had never felt so loved, and i had never loved anyone as much as i loved him. but his family never accepted us because they’re very religious and we were atheists. so of course they thought i was the one pressuring him to stop being religious (which is obviously not true). his mother is a typical “boy mom.” she was always paranoid, thinking i would steal her son from her or turn him against his family. she has also been diagnosed with several mental health conditions and is known for making her family’s life a literal hell. she’s very manipulative and have intense breakdowns. her husband has been trying to divorce her for decades, but she keeps threatening to take her own life if he does 🥲basically trapping him. things got even worse when this one old, creepy guy found out we were dating. he knew both of us, but he was in love with me and became extremely possessive (he’s literally married and has kids 😭). he told me that he would do anything to break us up because he couldn’t stand that “a girl as pretty as you would date a guy like him.” the problem is, this guy is an old friend of my ex’s family. they trust him a lot because he’s seen as a nice man: rich, married, with kids, and supposedly “happy” (💀🤡). he made their minds against me. he told them i was an opportunist, gold digger, and had bad intentions. i tried warning my ex’s family about him many times, but they never believed me. it got to the point where this man convinced my ex’s mom to force him to a mental health hospital just to keep him away from me. this ended in a suicide attempt 💔 he was found unconscious and spent days in the hospital, nearly dying. all of this traumatized him deeply. as much as he loved me, yesterday he told me that he officially doesn’t feel anything for me anymore. i can’t stop crying 😭😭 why is life so unfair? 😞 i just want my sweet boy to be happy i miss him so much, and i know that his family, especially his mom is always going to make him suffer so much because since he was a kid she's been doing crazy stuff that forever traumatizes him 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭",breakup,1,2383.0,459.0,5.0,0.010893246187363835,0.023965141612200435,0.0784313725490196,1.0,0.0

"did i make a mistake breaking up with my ex of 7 years? i can’t stop thinking about him. it’s been a year since i ended a 7-year relationship, and i still can’t shake the feeling that i may have made a mistake. i was going through a lot mentally at the time and thought breaking up would give me space to heal and grow. but now i’m starting to question if i walked away from something rare and meaningful. for reference i’m (f23) and he’s (m24). so we were together since teenagers. my ex is someone i deeply cared for. he had all the qualities i admire—driven, loyal, hardworking. he’s a college graduate with a master’s in finance, a minor in history, and he owns a home that he currently rents out—he’s literally a landlord at our age. he’s been working since he was 14, is a car guy with multiple vehicles (a truck, a motorcycle, a couple mopeds), and overall just had his life together. he came from a loving two-parent household, which showed in how grounded and respectful he was. he would fly me out for my birthday, surprise me with expensive gifts, and he had a genuinely good heart. but i didn’t leave without reason. as close as we were, it started to feel more like a friendship or roommate dynamic than a romantic relationship. we rarely went on dates. i wasn’t always sexually fulfilled or emotionally pursued in the way i needed. i craved deeper intimacy, more consistent effort in affection and romance. and truthfully, i wasn’t in a good mental space either. i was overwhelmed and felt like i was losing myself, so i thought taking space was the only way to figure out who i was becoming. since then, i’ve tried dating and talking to new people, but nothing feels the same. i get turned off quickly. most men i meet now seem lazy, unmotivated, emotionally unavailable, or just looking for sex. i want a provider—someone who sees me as a future wife, not just a placeholder. the truth is, i still can’t picture having a family with anyone but my ex. i haven’t been able to feel that deep level of comfort and safety with anyone else. one thing this year of being single has taught me is that when people say, “enjoy your twenties, party, be free”—it’s not always fulfilling. i’ve experienced that lifestyle, and it honestly feels hollow. if you’re fortunate enough to find your person early on, someone with real values who wants to build a life with you—don’t throw that away too fast. your twenties aren’t just for partying. they’re for laying the foundation for your future. personally, my goal has always been marriage, kids, and generational wealth. i want to build stability now, not wait until i’m burnt out or jaded later in life. so now i’m left wondering: did i make the wrong decision by leaving someone who truly cared for me? should i even be dating right now—or should i stay single and focus on healing and continuing to work on myself first?",breakup,1,2874.0,547.0,6.0,0.010968921389396709,0.003656307129798903,0.08775137111517367,3.0,0.0

"out of nowhere break up i (30’s m) was broken up with by my girlfriend (30 f) out of what felt like absolutely nowhere and although we were together just two months it feels so utterly confusing. i have had long term relationships, but this was the first relationship i have ever had where it felt perfect from the start and i felt like she wanted to be with me so much i was almost taken aback. she made me feel seen and desired and kept reciprocating how great it was all feeling to me. did things like wrote me letters, sent me postcards, made me little gifts, told me how special i was. then kind of out of nowhere she broke up with me. we had like two disagreements that weren’t even fundamental to who we are, just things that anyone should talk about and she just bailed. she said it was because of a “gut feeling” but when she broke up with me it felt like she threw the kitchen sink at me for reasons to break up. she said we were incompatible, we weren’t sexually compatible, i didn’t increase her zest for life, i was not positive enough, our sense of humors didn’t align, she didn’t feel the spark, the idea of moving in together in a year didn’t fill her with joy, what if she wanted to pick up and travel the world for two years? like every reason under the sun and i was like “wow it sounds like you really really don’t want to be with me.” and she was like “i didn’t come here to break up with you. i’m not sure how i feel.” and i was like “ummm i think you have listed every reason under the sun people break up.” and she asked “what if i change my mind in a week?” and said things like “i’m probably gonna go home and cry a lot about this” and i was just like trying for two hours to suss out what was going on and then she said her gut was telling her not to be with me. and i said “okay… bye then” and she asked me for a hug and i was like “what?? no.” it was so unbelievably random and out of nowhere and made me feel so embarrassed how quickly i had developed feelings for her. wtf was that? it was absolute whiplash. does anyone know what this kind of thing is? like how someone can completely turn on a dime? i just want some kind of closure because it was deeply unsettling how epic the flip was.",breakup,1,2221.0,450.0,7.5,0.017777777777777778,0.0044444444444444444,0.09555555555555556,5.0,0.0

(i know it is childish) i decided to not do it either. we went on like this for a week. after that we had a talk about breaking up, but i told her that we can try and work it out. her main concern was that i was not showing enough affection towards her, which i understand. and immediately after i tried was more affectionate, but i felt something was off. several days after our talk, she told me she cheated on me during these days we didn’t talk. i was in disbelief. she is one of the nicest, kindest people i know and she is also religious so i would never expect sth like this from her. here is what happened: one of her classmates grabbed her for the ass, she didn’t do anything to stop him, then kissed her and she didn’t stop him again even made out. she told me she was feeling very low during this time. after i continually asked her for details, she finally told me that they even went to her place. they made out some more pleasured each other and that was it. i am so shocked right now. she apologized to me, she told me she was an awful person and regrets it and says she would never do it again. i cant really trust her at all. also she said that her feeling low was no excuse. so i have to decide right now. do i break up with her or not? the problem is i still love her, but i also don’t want to be the biggest loser on earth who gets cheated on and just forgets it. she says she would never do it again, but i don’t really trust that right now. after i first the first part where they kissed i was more likely to forgive, but when i heard the second part i am very disappointed. what do you think i should do? if you need anymore information let me know! i need advice badly. thank you for reading this! tldr : my girlfriend of a year and a half cheated on me with a guy from her class. i really need advice on how to continue. should i break up with her?",breakup,1,2618.0,528.0,4.0,0.007575757575757576,0.001893939393939394,0.10227272727272728,4.0,0.0
"i (f19) broke 4 months of no contact with my ex (genderfluid 19) to stand up for myself—and i thought it would help, but i just feel worse four months ago, i went no contact with someone who emotionally manipulated me. it wasn’t a long relationship only a month, but it wrecked me. they were my first everything—date, kiss, love, sex i was brand new to dating, freshly out the closet as a lesbian. figuring out who i was, and i fell hard. because i’m an admitted lover girl. they took advantage of my kindness and inexperience. they made me feel so wanted, special, chosen. but i wasn’t really chosen. i was just the side piece—someone they kept around while chasing someone else. they tried to leave me twice, and i begged them to stay. that’s the part that still makes me ache. i gave so much of myself to someone who never had any intention of loving me back. i ruined myself a million little times for them. so much so that when i look back. i don’t recognize the foolish girl that i acted like around them. i only left when i asked them to commit and they couldn’t. wouldn’t. the last time we spoke before this they asked me to talk. about what i’ll never know. not like i really want to now anyways. i’m pretty certain what it was. perhaps to lie through their teeth and lovebomb me again. they claimed they missed me. i doubt it i bet they only missed the endless blind affection i gave them. when i was so blindly infatuated with them. even when they hurt me so badly and i never had the courage to speak up until i dumped them. i told them i knew i was just their side piece and to never contact me again and blocked them. i tattled on them to their boyfriend for cheating. and then they moved on like it meant nothing. like i meant nothing. for four months, i stayed silent. i grieved. i journaled. i went to therapy. i started to feel like me and recognize myself again—lighter, clearer, no longer consumed by them. everyone around me said i seemed like i was back to my old cheerful self again. i thought i was finally healed. but something inside me still needed to speak. not for attention, not to reopen anything—just to finally say what i couldn’t say when i was still bleeding. so i followed them briefly—just long enough to send this: “hey. you asked why i followed you again. truth is, i did it to prove to myself i’m not scared of you anymore. that you don’t have a hold on me like you used to. i can face the pain you caused without falling apart. i can say what you did hurt me—and not be afraid to admit it. the girl i was with you? that wasn’t me. that was someone shrinking herself to fit into the tiny space you made for her. someone who ruined herself a million little times just to feel wanted by you. you made me feel special, then discarded me like i meant nothing. so no, i don’t want you back. i’m just closing a chapter that haunted me for months. i’ve cried, screamed, journaled, healed, and grown. and the girl you knew? she’s gone. she was never real. this is me now. unapologetic. unafraid. done.” they replied with this: “don’t really know what to say. but bear with me. listen, i’ve fucked up a lot in my life. i just turned 19. starting a new chapter in my life. i’m rewriting my book. you were never supposed to fit into the narrative. i was also trying to find myself during the time ‘we had.’ but we only knew each other for two weeks. i regret some things i did. you’re a good person. and i’m trying to be one. i’ve moved on. and did a long time ago. i’ve got a lot going for me. and i hope you do too. i wish you best in life. this is me now. i’m not the same insecure, depressed, immature person you met. goodbye.” it was cold. detached. minimizing. like they were erasing everything. so i sent one final message: “it wasn’t two weeks — it was a whole fucking month, and don’t insult my intelligence by pretending otherwise. if rewriting the timeline helps you and your boyfriend sleep better at night, go ahead and live your fantasy. but don’t drag me into your delusions. i remember every hesitation, every half-truth, every time you pulled away and acted like it was nothing. you were a coward who couldn’t handle real love, so you made me feel like i was asking for too much when all i wanted was honesty. rewrite your story all you want — i’m living in reality now. and you? you’re not even a footnote anymore.” then i blocked them. fully. for good. i don’t care to hear their bs anymore. and now? even though i know i did the right thing—even though i’m not that broken girl anymore—i still feel awful. sad. angry. shaky. i thought standing up for myself would make me feel free. i thought it would help me move forward. but right now, it just feels like i opened a wound that was finally a healed scar. healing isn’t linear. i know that. but this hurts. badly. if you’ve ever broken no contact to say what needed to be said, and it still shattered you—how did you deal with the aftermath?

"no contact isn’t as easy as “just don’t do it.” i’ve seen so many posts and comments say stuff like “don’t reach out,” “it’s not worth it,” or “stay strong, no contact is the best option” and while i get where that advice is coming from and maybe deep down i even agree, it’s just not that simple when you’re the one actually going through it. no one really tells you how to do it. how to sit with the urge to message them when your chest physically aches. how to stop replaying every memory and wondering if it could’ve gone different. how to deal with nights that feel endless, when you’re alone with no one to talk to and they were once the person who made you feel safe. people don’t always realize how isolating it can be. not everyone has a solid group of friends or a supportive family. some of us truly feel like we’ve lost the one person we could be vulnerable with, even if the relationship wasn’t good for us. and sometimes, just knowing it wasn’t good doesn’t make the feelings go away. if anything, it makes them more confusing. every situation’s different. every heart heals at its own pace. so while “no contact” might be the right path, it doesn’t feel empowering at first, it feels like grief. it feels like silence screaming back at you. and in those moments, we don’t need just commands like “don’t do it.” we need understanding and compassion. a safe space to be real about how hard it actually is. so if you’re struggling with no contact right now, i see you. i feel you. you’re not weak. you’re not doing it wrong. you’re just human, and healing something that meant a lot to you. ❤️‍🩹",breakup,1,1607.0,319.0,7.5,0.03134796238244514,0.012539184952978056,0.034482758620689655,0.0,0.0

"gross but funny thing i’ve been thinking about i was broken up with almost two months ago, after trying again with the same girl after we broke up in january. recently, it has been discovered that my ex has been in a relationship with my friend for a month, that started two weeks after the breakup. said friend has been around my ex’s house, slept with them, been going out with them, the lot. whilst hiding it from me, our other friends and my friend’s long distance girlfriend. when i heard that this friend had stayed over at their house, i realised something really grim. basically, my ex is one of the messiest people i’ve ever met, this includes not changing their bedsheets on a regular basis. one time when i stayed around their house, i accidentally bleed on their bedsheets and it went through to the mattress. still, the sheets were not changed until a while later and they have no idea how to clean blood out of a mattress despite growing up around other women. so what i thought of was, my blood is still on that mattress, and those sheets, because yes, whilst they were washed at the beginning of march, the blood didn’t come out. my ex is stuck with a forever bloodied mattress and my friend has slept in my period blood, as has anyone else that they have had sleeping in that bed. ew.",breakup,1,1301.0,245.0,7.5,0.0326530612244898,0.0,0.08163265306122448,0.0,0.0

"this is the closure i needed. everything makes sense now haha so my friend sent me my ex's bio which said ""wore a borrowed skin for a love not my own. now unmasking to bloom where i am truly known."" which means, the phrase ""wore a borrowed skin for a love not my own"" is a metaphorical expression. it suggests a feeling of being inauthentic or pretending to be someone else in order to pursue a relationship or affection that was not genuinely meant for them. the ""borrowed skin"" represents a false persona or a way of acting that is not true to oneself, while the ""love not my own"" highlights the unrequited or ultimately unattainable nature of the affection being sought. i knew everything was fake, after he brokeup with me over that he lost feelings and i was treating him shit. and i never got to know anything beyond that. that fucking victim mindset of his. now he's putting bio and username like it's ok to be forgotten? who forgot you man, your ex lmao i hope this man never finds you. everything was fake. all he did was pretend to come into a relationship and when he realised i'm not what he thought or wanted or i'm just not his ex, he just left me after disrespecting me and sl&t shaming me. i hope he rots in h3ll.",breakup,1,1229.0,233.0,3.0,0.012875536480686695,0.02145922746781116,0.07296137339055794,1.0,0.0
"left holding everything - partner leaving, possibly cheating, emotionally cold, and i’m exhausted i’m 31 and live in the uk. my husband (34) and i have been together for 8.5 years, married for 3.5. last month, after a mental health breakdown due to years of burnout, grief, and emotional exhaustion, he told me he wasn’t happy and didn’t want to be in the relationship anymore. we share two children - twin boys (13) from his previous relationship, whose mum died in 2020. i adopted them. one of them has additional needs, which brings its own challenges, but i love them with all my heart. seeing them heartbroken is devastating. he originally said he wanted to work on things, came back home, and then just… didn’t try. no affection. i had to ask for hugs. he finally admitted he didn’t want to kiss me anymore, and then ended it completely. now he’s still living in our home while “sorting himself out” - using the living room as a bedroom, making no effort to keep it tidy, leaving me feeling completely stuck in limbo. there’s also another woman. i found 19 calls to her in the 4 days before we split. at the beginning of this week he disappeared for the evening and then told me he went to her house to “eat dinner and watch love island”. a few days later, he finished work at midday (normally works til 5/6) had a shower and doused himself in aftershave then left to “give her a lift” to the garage. he was gone for 5 hours. this weekend, while supposedly housesitting for his mum (which he’s never done before), he said he was going to be out from early morning til late at night (yesterday/saturday) but refused to tell me where he’d be — then was seen by my sister going to the same woman’s home again after denying that he was spending the day with her. he still denies it and calls her “just a friend.” he says one of the reasons our relationship broke down is because my grief made us drift apart - that losing my dad and grandad (both of whom i cared for through cancer, until their deaths last year) made it hard for us to be a couple. said it was inconvenient for him. he even says the fact i was raped and tortured before we got together “bothers” him, because it makes him uncomfortable not knowing who the attacker is so he can’t relax when he goes out with friends. i’ve also supported him financially for years. before christmas, he decided he “didn’t want to work anymore” and i covered everything. right now, he owes me £17,000 and hasn’t acknowledged it. once he moves out, i’ll need to find an extra £1,500/month just to keep up with bills and rent. i feel rage. i feel grief. i feel betrayed. i’ve kept our family, our finances, and our home going while he’s planned an escape - and now i’m the one rebuilding from scratch. i don’t want sympathy. i want to know: how do i get through this part? the anger, the exhaustion, the heartbreak, the sheer unfairness of it? if you’ve been here - especially if you’ve come out the other side - what helped you find peace or power again?",breakup,1,3003.0,559.0,7.5,0.017889087656529516,0.005366726296958855,0.07334525939177101,3.0,0.0

"avoidant discard: is there a chance he will reach out? despite long distance and problems we had short version: he avoidant discarded me and i want him to reach out again after few months, because i have heard it is possible. i truly loved him and if i knew he was avoidant earlier i could do so much stuff differently. i am not contacting him on purpose, because now he is like a brick wall. there was a lot of issues in our relationship, like intimacy issues, my mental health issues and he had no money, no support and i was helping him so maybe it hindered his confidence around me. i am also very vocal person and i like to sort issues with talking, which he always tried to run away from. due to circumstances we had to go temporarily long distance and he was meant to find flat for us, he never did so i accepted it and was willing to wait until he is ready. now he is on his feet he discarded me, said he lost feelings 4 weeks ago, i feel used and lied to. his promises ruined my life and left me with no money. so i know he feels guilty, but he also has reasons to twist me in his brain into some disgusting codependent person. is there a chance he will reach out after months or a chance he will miss me and remember me, despite the baggage and long distance? long story for people who want more context: the story of our relationship is filled with turmoil from external stuff like jobs and student poverty, it lasted over 3 years. he was struggling a lot, i mean like a lot. due to his issues i supported him to the best of my ability and i sacrificed for him, over span of 2 years i gave this man over 5000 £. at some point in the relationship we had intimacy issue around sex, he was ill and not in the mood, but i found out he was watching a lot of porn on the side. i accepted it initially, but as time went on and his illness was becoming manageable nothing changed from his perspective, which to me looked like he does not enjoy looking at my body and he does not care to help our issue. he reassured me, made promises to cut down on porn, but he lied, every time i asked him why he does it so much he would say that he does not know. so i was confused, but left it alone after a year of struggle, but we did not have sex for a very long time. he probably feels guilty for hurting me so badly, cos it put me in a really rough shape. if i knew he was avoidant i would handle all of it differently. our relationship was still strong, we were each others best friends and we were still really loving. i built my life around him (clearly out of my own stupidity), i refused job opportunities, didnt make independent plans, worked on my insecurities, lost pre settled status in the uk, i had to leave uk to wait for him - those decisions were all fuelled by how loved he made me feel and his promises. then there came time when he was put back on his tracks, he finally gained independence from his parents and got a job he wanted. i supported him and was so happy for him. now i was the one needing his help, i was traumatised by job experiences and had anger issues (never lashed out on him, but i know it bothered him). i got diagnosed with adhd, autism, anxiety, depression, ocd and cptsd. i worked on myself and saw the results, he was meant to find a flat for us so i can come join him in england (life forced us to be temporary long distance). he said he is happy to provide for me and that he just wants me to be happy. he said he wanted to repay me for stuff i did for him in his darkest time. i always mistook his calm and stoic attitude for sign of emotional maturity. if i knew he was that level of dismissive avoidant back then i could easily identify the signs and i would know that this level of responsibility and his fear of losing independence would cause him to crumble and i will become danger and liability to preserving his routine. he never said he needed me to be certain way, he never voiced any issues or concerns. and then poof, one night before he was meant to come visit me he texted me he that he is not coming because he does not want to. i called him, i was furious, i was pleading with him to come just to see if he is right about his feelings, i asked why and got meet with vagueness. he said that four weeks ago he decided that he does not love me anymore because he stopped missing me. when i asked him why he stopped living me he said he does not know, that it is the distance (that he was meant to solve by finding flat for us), that he has good routine he does not want to get rid off. i said that it is impossible, people dont just lose feelings for no reason and that he knows me being away is temporary due to my financial issues. i said that i helped him through his, so why when it is his turn he just suddenly does not love me. i said that he never communicated any concerns and said anything. his responses were silence or repeating the same vague stuff, he also said that he experiences a lot of anxiety and has to constantly be at his stressful job to numb himself. he says he feels sorry and he knows it is his fault i am in this position because of his promises. he also cried when i broke down to him about the fact that i lost everything because of my mental illness and people pleasing. in the morning when i was reading i realised that he was always da and i was just uneducated enough to see the signs. so i messaged him knowing he wont respond, but i had to because i care about him. i said he should consider wether he is a dismissive avoidant and adress his job anxiety (he is new prison guard), because it might get worse for him. i apologised for being angry and i said that i know i am not getting him back. i realised that i am fa because of that and i still want him back, but i will not say that to him. i feel that if i knew our attachment styles there is no much stuff that i would fix, so much things i would do differently. i have heard they do reach out after few months, but when i look at the way i mistreated him because of my lack of understanding and he could never say it to me because of his avoidance, and when i look at the fact it is long distance and i can not come back to england because i am financially compromised, i doubt he will ever reach out, but i want it so badly. can you give me your thoughts on whether there is a chance or not?",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.007177033492822967,0.007177033492822967,0.10127591706539076,3.0,0.0

[if someone wants clarity, i'll give some more examples in the comments.] but i found out as i was sending some pictures from my friend's whatsapp to my number , with her consent. i didn't know how she had saved my contact so i just searched my name in the chatbox and voila, before my chat, other chats appeared with my name in them. all of them negative. it crushed me and broke my heart like never ever. i had been through the most terrible times in that year (majority of my friends never left a text to even check up on me even though they knew what was happening) still the only safety i had felt during those times was with those friends until i found out that they had been trashing me on the smallest of things, constantly speculating about my life and relationships etc. i have always celebrated my birthday on my own and arranged it for myself on my own. that year, i just needed a little love and consideration so i casually told them what i wanted for my birthday (which was just flowers, rings and homemade cupcakes- nothing else) but then i found out none of them wanted to do anything for me. more than that, they were discussing it how they're not interested and how i'm being so shameless and low asking for these things. tons of other things. one of them (lets call her a) had a reason that she felt like she couldn't come talk to me when she was falling apart with another mutual friend group. from my perspective, i listened to her and validated her but i offered her a perspectibe of the other side (which she saw as me defending them while invalidating her and she said you're more their friend than mine) and hence she drifted away. but would that justify trashing me so much to my friends? there are tons of comments and their backstories too. another friend (say: b) talked about me not only to my friend but also to her friends who didn't know me and there was so much shit that my mind was blown. i had never meant any of that to come off as that deep or disgusting as she made it out to be. friend c is a very impressionable person. she's the sweetest and kindest human ever but if she respects someone, her opinions will become what that respectable person says. in this case, friend b is a goddess in her eyes so it already made sense for her to be so conceited towards me. some of the things were right, that i come off as prickly sometimes (it's never intentional. its just straightforward statement with no smile but even my sister said you sometimes seem rude. and i am working on that). some were downright wrong i don't understand why these girls assumed so much malice on my part. they have only been talking to one another, hopefully not outside of my circle. i also never assumed anyone of them to be insecure or jealous of me. i have always been seen as a very attractive woman and have always had loads of male attention, even to an uncomfortable extent. i belong to an affluent and influential background but so does friend b. and friend a is so so gorgeous and confident and a social butterfly, literally rules our whole class and department so why would she have a reason to be jealous. [ even though last year my sister met them and she said she picked some negative vibes from her. she also made several comments about my skin, and how my body is sexy and that's what men find attractive even if a woman doesn't have a pretty face. i never thought anything about those comments cuz i am very secure in my looks] moving on, friend b is also pretty, rich, privileged and really classy (also the most respected person in our group) so i have no idea what went down. i feel like such a problem. now we're graduating and i'll finally confront them and leave the group (had my reasons for not leaving it 8 months back when i found out that i'll tell if someone wants to know) but what do i do? has anyone been through a similar situation? i am breaking up with them this week (and i'll have to see them again next month still during our defense and final clearances etc) i am kinda confused and satisfied but really satisfied.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.0091324200913242,0.0,0.09360730593607305,4.0,0.0

"regret or confusion i feel that i fucked up hard. i hope my story isn't too long, but i'm curious what do you think. we had been building our life quite quickly, because for a long time (8 months), we had never thought about leaving each other. she moved to me pretty fast (~3 weeks), and after around 8 months we moved to a bigger flat. the reason being to make space for her clothing, and stuff, but i had became extremely exhausted and thought i can't bear it anymore how it felt living together. we went to therapy (even though i initiated discussions about our problems) but communication hardly worked. later i also realised some narcissistic behaviour (e.g. gaslighting, guilt-tripping and shifting). after valentianes, i just snapped and felt, that's enough, and dumped her. (afterwards i apologised and tried to start again, but she had gradually lost feelings.) since then, i've been suffering a lot, but i started letting go since a while. the point is that i really think she was special, we made so many happy memories. it was so great to travel with her anywhere, we had the same interests, a bit childish behaviour, cuteness. love for animals, gaming. i liked how she squirted and moaned, and her bright blue eyes. it really felt like a unique bond. and i know it was partly trauma-bond and partly something that was made by our deviant personality. but we had a lot of arguments, and for some reason they became worse and worse until we drove each other insane to the point i despised and sometimes even hated her. we were trying to fix us, but we couldn't. and i regret this. that i couldn't see the good in her, and there is no turning back now. as writing this i just got confused. i actually don't regret it, rather proud of that when the last moment when we discussed what to do she said ""we can fix this with 1 year therapy"" i replied: ""and we ruin each other until then?"". fuck, i'm not sure, but maybe at that moment i felt the pain more. she wanted to marry me, but i knew there is a long way ahead. somehow, separation was inevitable, but i realised many of my mistakes and i could accept her as she is, but she moved on. i'm just another villain in her story now. i miss her so much, her personality, her thighs.",breakup,1,2239.0,411.0,3.0,0.0072992700729927005,0.0072992700729927005,0.10948905109489052,1.0,0.0

"3 months later it’s been a little less than 3 months since my ex bf 31m broke up with me 31f after 13 years, and it still feels like day 1 for me. meanwhile he met a new girl only 1 month after we broke up, and is already in a committed relationship with her. i know what everyone says, that this is most likely a “rebound” but i genuinely never thought he was the type of person who would do that, so it hurts a lot. we didn’t have a bad breakup, he just lost feelings because of his mental illness and his ptsd from being a police officer. it sucks because just 3 weeks ago he was telling me that he misses me, looks at old pictures of us all the time, and that he wishes he communicated with me more when he wasn’t feeling good about things as maybe it would have saved the relationship. how does someone go from saying all that to then being in love and involved with someone new? it is absolutely heartbreaking. it is already so difficult to try to grieve and move on from a breakup you did not want.. but then to see them move on like you meant nothing? wild. now he is obviously acting cold with me, as he has replaced me with a new person so i am of no use for him anymore. the only thing that is somewhat keeping my mind at ease is that i know she is a rebound and he is trying to fill a void (he told me) but that doesn’t mean it won’t work out between them. his mom has also reached out to me and said that she has no idea who her son is anymore, and that he has changed into a completely different person who she doesn’t recognize (he also pushed her away because of his mental illness) which i know is common. any advice?",breakup,1,1634.0,328.0,7.0,0.021341463414634148,0.006097560975609756,0.057926829268292686,3.0,0.0
"i think we moved too fast and i ruined everything i want to preface this with i don’t think this really counts as a break up even though it feels like one. we met a few days ago but it hurts like one. we met off of a subreddit (i’m 25 and she’s 20) and we just hit it off right away. we would text throughout the day, talk all night and we just really knew what we wanted. at least that’s what i thought, i wrote her a poem and she wrote me one too about being each other’s safe space and how we want to grow with each other. i had skepticism early on because she was younger but she spoke as though she was very mature and would easily answer or support me when i had any doubt or insecurities. she only lived a couple hours away and i told her i wanted to take her on a date soon and she was happy to hear that and wanted the same, she even offered to meet me half way. i declined and said i thought it be important if her family met me since i don’t want them thinking she’s just going out with a stranger. well last night i wanted to send her something so i asked for her address, i sent her flowers and i guess her mom/brother lost it because she gave a stranger their address. she said she would smooth things over with them, i guess she kind of did but her mom asked for my dl id so i sent it. after a gruesome hour of waiting for a reply she apologized for the delay and then just told me this whole relationship was “inappropriate” and that it would be best if we “went our separate way for now”, which crushed me. i’m in this weird state now and i don’t know what to do. i just replied with an apology and just said i understood. i wrote her another poem but idk if i should even send it.",breakup,1,1698.0,355.0,1.0,0.0028169014084507044,0.011267605633802818,0.12112676056338029,0.0,0.0

"ex stalking socials despite being the one dumping me? it's been 10 months since we broke up, she ""seems"" to be doing well and is a lot more outgoing than i am. i'm getting there, although it's not the best, i'm hanging on. made new friends, picked up new hobbies and busy with university and the gym. we had some rough 9-10 day reconnection 6 months ago after our 4 month no contact period directly after the break up. we also last spoke during march. both time periods did not end well whatsoever. like her past patterns, she continues to vilify me, twists the narrative, leaked personal info of me to her friends then twists it and spreads information about me which are blatantly false. last month i woke up to an instagram notification from her, it was her requesting to follow me. i click on the notification because i was obviously stunned and confused, only for the request to be gone. i dwelled on it for a few hours of course before shrugging it off. fast forward till now, 2 days ago i also got a notification from her on tik tok, that she viewed my profile. i wasn't even sure it was her at first till i went onto the account which confirmed her identity. her reposts are pretty much just ""self love"", loving her best friend, couple tik toks and all that bullshit to be honest. despite being the one who abruptly dumped me and even acknowledging being the ""asshole"" or ""villain"", i've noticed that i'm always hearing/seeing something from her in some way within a burst of every 2-3 months. never beyond the 4 months where i hear nothing. also, the reason i didn't block her was because during the time it was easier for me to spiral since she was a lot more accessible towards me from a few buttons away. i'm not sure what's happening nor why she's exactly doing this other than a brief assumption. do i confront her the next time she does it with evidence so she won't have the ability to gaslight me or do i continue being silent? anyways, i thought it would be nice to hear different outside perspectives of this. like always, thank you all for taking your time to read this.",breakup,1,2090.0,379.0,6.0,0.0158311345646438,0.002638522427440633,0.0712401055408971,2.0,0.0

how to get over a friend/ex crush 19m used to like 18m at my job. my friend 22m also knows (he doesn't know i stopped i think). i realized 18m is taken (but is gay or bi idk) so i stopped talking to him. he asked why am i not talking anymore i just said i'm stressed (which is true because my mom has breast cancer and he knows) so i started ignoring (at first when i found out he was taken) and he asked do you hate me i said no. he did a lot of toxic stuff (if you look at some posts in my profile there's more details) my friends and sister said he's a asshole and i gotta ignore him. i let 22m know (im not talking to him because he did something i disliked and that made me uncomfortable using his training on me and giving me much more anxiety) because we used to be a trio of friends. 18m is also getting cocky because he's becoming a shift manager and i'll have to talk too him anyway when he finally becomes shift manager. he put me down a lot but we have some similarities. i feel really guilty and sad for ignoring him because work isn't fun without him. i also feel lonely because 22m is my only friend now. has anybody gone through something like this? if you have any advice please answer (and i don't know all this crap about me liking someone on the job. if i'm with someone a lot sometimes you feel something it happens) i wanna tell 22m but he's having a mental health week because someone gave him permission to and he's gonna be resting and with his gf f26. i encouraged him a lot when he said he was taking the break so i gotta wait. me and 18m only like night shifts so we're gonna se each other a lot anyway no matter what. tl;dr how to get over a toxic ex work friend/crush and keep working without feeling guilty.,breakup,1,1738.0,348.0,5.0,0.014367816091954023,-0.011494252873563218,0.09482758620689655,1.0,0.0

"when did you realize they weren't coming back, and how did you cope? for context, all of my previous exes and situationships came back. all of them. some to have another go at the relationship after ~6 months no contact. some simply to apologize or to clear their conscience. but they all reached out to me after shorter or longer periods of silence, for one reason or another. this relationship, if i could call it that - feels different. after 3 months of silence, i am coming to the realization that he will never try to reach out to me again. he strung me along for 8 months, treating me like crap, under the excuse that ""he's been hurt in the past, trying to open up, needs more time"" etc. i'll spare the details, cause it's embarrassing to even think about how i allowed this man to treat me, but buttom line is, he never cared about me. his actions proved this to me over and over again, i just failed to accept this for the longest time, because i was in love, and wanted to believe that he cared, because he said he did. typical. we went no contact 3 months ago. he passively breadcrumbed me during that time - stopped watching my stories, then started watching them again, even rewatching them at times. i kept on waiting, and hoping, and praying he would reach out. but he didn't, and i ended up removing him off everywhere, to preserve my sanity... yet i still held out hope he would message. a few days ago was my 30th birthday. he didn't reach out. that's when the final realization set in - he never cared. he couldn't stand being held accountable, even at times when i would gently bring up that he was hurting me. of course he will never reach back out. he would have to face the damage he's done, and he never cared about me enough to do that. that's just how this story ends. there will be no closure, like the kind i've received in all of my previous relationships. and i somehow have to be okay with that, and find it in me to let go and move forward. in cases like this, how do you cope with the fact that the story is just over? i feel paralyzed at the thought that those 8 months of my life are just... gone without any meaning... the pain of never getting any closure from the person i cared about so much feels unbearable..",breakup,1,2249.0,418.0,6.0,0.014354066985645933,0.0023923444976076554,0.07177033492822966,2.0,0.0

"the need to make them acknowledge what they did hi, okay so i was with my boyfriend for 9 months. we were friends for 8 months before that. he was a typical nice guy. u can't expect him to hurt anyone. the thrill of going going from friends to more than friends was great, we had great chemistry, a great connection, loved each other's company- my boyfriend was my best friend. amazing. (i should mention i had a great social life outside of this relationship too) now for the problems- he was not emotionally supportive and that's something i really needed in a relationship. i needed reassurances (love language), to have someone check up on me randomly (he didn't even check up when i was going thru stuff or i was sick). but then we'd talk or meet and it would be great. that's why i let everything else slide. but there were times when his emotional negligence and dismissive behavior really really hurt me. while i voiced these things i was also really considerate about it as to not make him feel bad. we broke up and i told him all this and he said sorry but i still don't think he understands the actual extent of how hurt i was. in the last month of the relationship, i felt unloved and uncared for my the person i loved and cared for so much. the catch is while this was all going on, we broke up for different reasons (i'm moving countries). and i know while i have tried to voice as much as the hurt as i can i know if anyone asks him abt why he and i broke up he'd lead with oh our goals weren't aligning when in reality he hurt me so bad i couldnt bare being with him. he lacked emotional intelligence, emotional maturity and empathy to even make space for what i'm saying let alone trying to understand it. this stings me. i want his friends to know. i want him to acknowledge everything. edit: to add to this, post break up i wanted to go no contact while he wanted to wean off, try to stay friends for a while. after a lot of back and forth, he got his way. i actually removed him from my instagram and since we're still in contact on text l, i let him know that ""hey jbtw i removed u from insta, letting u know so there aren't any surprises"". he reacted really weirdly to this and told me he doesn't feel good and he ended up talking to me on call begging me to add him back because he wasn't ready. i budged, felt bad. after this we also engageg in things i should not have been engaging in with my ex, let alone an ex i was really hurt by. it was usually him initiating conversation but i was available all the time. the last time we talked was a month ago because he said this isn't healthy lol. and that's how it stopped. i felt stupid. i also want to mention i know this is unhealthy lol. i know this this coming from a place of low self esteem. the fact that i let so many things in the relationship slide was due to low self esteem, ppl pleasing tendencies, fear of abandonment. i then went ahead and bent my own rules and let him push my boundaries. so i take this relationship as a lesson. but my question is , how do i move on from the need for acknowledgement? being available after the break up made every thing worse. although it's been 3 months for the actual break up and i'm definitely in a much better place, my feelings for him have decreases too and i'm getting better. it's just this vengeful acknowledgement need that i can't shake off. i know i can't control the narrative but i have to shake off that need to want to.",breakup,1,3459.0,664.0,7.5,0.016566265060240965,0.0,0.10090361445783133,1.0,0.0

"she cheated and i miss her .. she told me it was over on march 17. said she found someone else who made her happy and that she wanted to be with him. at first i was stunned but i tried to respect her decision. what came after that wasn’t closure though. it was manipulation. she kept contacting me. not always directly, but just enough to make it feel like the door wasn’t fully shut. calls. messages. emotional bait. she didn’t act like someone who had let go. she acted like someone who still wanted to control the situation even if she was already gone. even after saying she had moved on, she kept guilt tripping me. on april 21 she said i violated her trust and humiliated her publicly. that i forced her to leave. she said i drained her bank account. that i used her. she made it sound like i was the one who broke her. but i never asked her for anything. never took anything she didn’t offer. i didn’t lie. i didn’t play games. i was still trying to understand what happened and instead she flipped the entire story on me. then came april 25. she sent over 40 emails and messages that day. all over the place. one minute she’s calling me papi. telling me she loves me. that she doesn’t want anyone else. then she’s saying i never loved her. that i just used her. that i ruined her life and made her miss work. she said i broke her mentally and emotionally. said i abandoned her. then told me i could still fix it. that i was the one playing games. she said she was forced to give someone else a chance because i ignored her. but by then it was already too late. she had already slept with someone else. i found that out for sure on april 27 when i finally confronted her and said it out loud. all those messages she sent me after the breakup, all the emotions and guilt, were just a way to distract me from what she had already done. when i told her i knew, she didn’t deny it. she just went quiet. she breadcrumbed me. said it was over but kept tugging at my emotions like a string. she wanted to keep control. keep the power. keep me stuck. every message was a mix of love, pain, blame, and shame. she used me emotionally right after cheating on me. and the worst part is she made it feel like i was the one who did something wrong. like i failed her. but i didn’t. i was there. i was loyal. i was real. looking back now it’s clear. she didn’t want to be with me. she just didn’t want me moving on. she couldn’t handle losing the narrative. so every time i started to let go she’d send something just strong enough to pull me back in. but it was never about love. it was about control. she cheated. she lied. she rewrote the timeline. and she did it all while pretending to be the one who got hurt. it wasn’t heartbreak. it wasn’t confusion. it was betrayal. and i finally saw it for what it was.",breakup,1,2805.0,556.0,5.0,0.008992805755395683,0.0017985611510791368,0.08992805755395683,0.0,0.0

"the breakup didn’t break me. it revealed everything i had been ignoring. used to think the hardest part of a breakup was the loss. the silence. the missing them. but what really hit me was realizing how much of myself i had lost while trying to keep someone who was never really choosing me in the first place. i ignored red flags. i over-explained. i stayed even when i felt small. and when it ended, it hurt like hell but it also forced me to face everything i had been avoiding. that’s when i knew i didn’t just need to move on. i needed to heal. i ended up writing a lot through that process and eventually created something called the real love manual. it’s everything i wish someone had handed me in the middle of my spiral. it helped me understand why i stayed too long, why i confused anxiety with love, and how to stop repeating the same patterns. if you’re in that weird place where you’re still hurting but starting to see things clearly — you’re not alone. and if you’re choosing peace this time instead of going back to what broke you, that’s real progress. curious what helped you turn the corner after your breakup? let’s talk.",breakup,1,1142.0,221.0,5.0,0.02262443438914027,0.004524886877828055,0.09502262443438914,1.0,0.0

"struggling with blindsided breakup i'm really struggling to make sense of what's happened, and i just need a place to let it out. i was in a relationship for 8 months with someone who i genuinely believed was serious about me. when we first started dating, he was incredibly full-on, constantly calling, texting, saying he’d never felt a connection like this before. he told me he loved me early on, he met my family 4 months in, introduced me to his kids and family 6 months in and we constantly talked about our future, even moving in together. he had been broken up with his ex for 4 months when we met. he told me she had emotionally cheated, that she’d reported him to the police during a heated argument (which was dropped), and that their relationship was toxic. he painted her as manipulative, emotionally damaging, and someone he wanted nothing to do with. he said she ruined him, reassured me that he had no feelings left for her and that he was ready to move forward. he told me i was the person he saw his future with. naturally, i had some doubts throughout the 8 months, especially because he brought her up constantly. i was honest with him about how that made me feel and he always reassured me that he was over it. i chose to believe him and i worked through those doubts with him. we got on really well, felt very comfortable with eachother, he was warm, affectionate, he was my best friend. i felt safe with him. then out of nowhere, 1 week ago, he ended things over text saying he wasn't emotionally ready to give me what i need, that he needed to be alone to deal with his emotions and heal from the damage his ex had caused. he said he was still in love with his ex and needed to work on that. he also said he ""still wanted me in his life but couldn't give me 100%"". i tried to call, to understand what had happened but he ignored me. he completely cut me off and instantly removed me from all social media. i was left completely blindsided and heartbroken. i couldn’t and still can't make sense of how someone who said they loved me and was planning a life with me could just switch off like that. how you can talk to someone everyday for 8 months, say you love someone and want to be with them forever and then suddenly disappear? there were no signs, he was even acting normal the day before when i saw him. and now, i’ve found out he’s back with his ex, which i'm pretty sure happened the same day he brokeup with me. the same ex he swore he was done with, the same ex he said he’d never forgive or get back with. i feel like i was lied to the entire time, like i was just a placeholder while he waited for her to take him back. and now, everything he said to me, all the i love yous, the future talk, the promises feel like lies, like i never really mattered. i’m trying to cope but the betrayal is so crushing. i’ve been stuck in my head replaying everything, trying to figure out what was real and what wasn’t. i gave him so much of myself, stood by him during his hardest moments, and he just disappeared and ran back to the person he claimed hurt him the most. i guess i’m just struggling to process it all. how can someone say all those things, do all those things and then blindside you like that? thanks for reading if you got this far. i’m just trying to make sense of it all and figure out how to move forward.",breakup,1,3346.0,644.0,7.5,0.020186335403726708,0.004658385093167702,0.08229813664596274,2.0,0.0

"my boyfriend and i broke up. my boyfriend (m17) and i (f18) broke up after 7 months. my ex boyfriend rarely showed his vulnerable side to me, it always he had this wall around him. he was not the type to show vulnerability and weakness, even around me. we broke up twice and i know it's not healthy but each time i thought that ""maybe this time, we'll go back to how it used to."" but somehow we never went back to how it used to be. the first time it happened, it was an attempt– he said he was under a lot of stress because of some matters in his home but i told him that we can get by it. i stopped getting upset with him, stopped sulking, stop doing whatever girl's do with their boyfriend. i didn't want to add up to his stress. there was another attempt to break up with me when we were on a vacation abroad. he told me after a few days after his first attempt that i deserved better, that he was becoming toxic to me but as always, i told him ""no, i want you. i want to fix this"" then the first break up happened. the reason why we broke up was because he said that i deserved better again and that he couldn't be better for me. i told him ""it's okay if you aren't better, i just don't want you to break up with me"" but he didn't fought and so we broke up. the second break up happened after a two weeks again after we made up the same day we broke up but this time, we had this huge argument where our teacher said that ""her mom isn't going to approve you."" she told me ""you deserve better. don't go down from your status for him"" and it made him insecure which i understand and so he used the excuse college to break up with me. 3 days later, we got back and now.. we broke up again but not that he initiated it but i did. i understand that his love language was to be all touchy and clingy with my body but he was listing over it, to the point of me becoming an object to him. whenever we called each other, he was like ""can i see your..."" and told me that if we ever get married, i should get used to it because that's how a relationship last. then earlier today, he kept saying ""you should find someone else"", ""your next boyfriend.."", ""you will eventually find someone else, you know."" that's when i got exhausted of us. i told him today ""stop it. you don't have to force yourself to love me. you don't have to force yourself to need me, you can just leave. i know i was a bad person to you and i'm sorry. so now, you're free"" and he left. he replied to me with a simple message of ""sorry for everything. thanks for the 7 months, it was the best months of my life. goodluck in college and take care, i love you."" so where did it all went wrong? why didn't he fight for our relationship? why didn't he changed? i changed so much for him..

""do you believe me that i am going to change?"" - ""i don't know, but i don't think so, because i don't think you can"". - and then they just left, leaving me standing there. in the letter, they briefly told me that they felt they were losing themself, that i was belittling them, they couldn't be my whole world anymore, that we needed to be apart to grow as individuals. again, that they love me so much and respect me. and i know all of that. i have a lot of trauma that i have been working through for years, also with a therapist, and have made a lot of progress, but apparently it was not enough. i struggle very badly with fear of abandonment, causing me to be clingy and jealous and also very mean sometimes. but it was always something i was willing to work on, i always said we should talk about it, they should communicate with me, call me out on my bs and look for solutions with me. but nothing happened; they brought it up very little, and if they did and i gave any backlash, the talk was immediately over. also, i expected them to do way too much for me. but if they didn't, i might have seemed disappointed, but i would have never blamed them, was never violent, insulting, whatever. so yes, i did a lot of things wrong. and my fear of losing them made me keep them small. but i always loved them, always wanted us to grow and talk about it, and there was nothing i would not have done to make it work. i was so willing to fight for it. but instead of communicating, they just skipped all possible stages of escalation and just left. yes, they also had and have a lot of issues. with themself, with expressing feelings, with communication, with criticism, with just having started working full time and being very unhappy with it. drinking and eating to regulate feelings. but they kept on pushing me away, whenever i wanted to support them, talk it out, help them grow. and whenever i talked about plans for the future, they were avoiding anything that was not very distant and vague. the night before they left, they were super lovey dovey. wanting to snuggle at night, spending all evening consciously with me and goofing around with me. just a few days ago, i had bought concert tickets for both of us without them making any hints at not being able to make it. and now they are just gone. for the first 48 hours, i kept on sending desperate messages, begging them to come back and talk to me and give me another chance after i finally realized how bad i truly needed to leave my comfort zone and change. after that, i kind of gave up. i am slowly starting to pack up their things as much as possible, not flinch whenever i hear the elevator, keep up my routines, go to work and be as independent as they always wanted me to be. two days ago, i asked them to please communicate with me when they plan on coming back to our apartment to get stuff or talk, so i am not in constant waiting mode, but nothing came back. tl;dr: i messes up really bad due to old wounds and not wanting to leave my comfort zone and they did not communicate how fed up they were getting with me and what was at risk and then just left our shared place and have been ignoring me since with their stuff all around me. i take full responsibility for everything except their inability to communicate, but it just hurts so much to have lost my best friend and my lover and what for the first time felt like family and home. and i keep on asking myself if any of it was ever true.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.015240328253223915,0.005861664712778429,0.10550996483001172,4.0,0.0
"my boyfriend of a year and a half broke up with me out of nowhere and i’m still so confused i’ve never posted anything on reddit, but i’m just so confused by what has transpired recently for me that i wanted to see if anyone had some advice or could relate to what i’m going through. i’ve been with my boyfriend for 1 1/2 years and our relationship has been nothing but amazing. we clicked instantly because of our similar interests, and there was a never a moment where we weren’t talking or making each other laugh. we also made it a point to see each other regularly and were heavily intertwined into each other’s families and friends. there was not a single inclination i had that we were breaking up anytime soon, and every interaction/behavior we had up to that point was completely normal. my last memory before we broke up was of him tucking me back into bed before he went to work, telling me he couldn’t wait to see me on saturday (normal date day for us), and then coming back one more time before he left because he wanted one final kiss. not what i would consider normal behavior for someone who was planning to break up with his girlfriend in 3 days. on saturday, i received a text from him in the morning saying that he apologized for this coming out of left field but he wanted to meet earlier to talk about some things. in my heart, i knew it sounded like he was about to break up with me but i was still so confused why this was happening now all of sudden. i drove to the location and met him there and he asks to get into my car to talk. right away, he breaks up with me. even though the earlier text sorta clued me into what was possibly happening, i still sat there in shock because i couldn’t actually believe this was real. what made me even more confused was the reason. for prior context, we have a slight age gap. me (24f) and him (27m). it’s never been a problem in the past because we got together out of college and when we were both in similar places in life (ie living in the same city and working jobs). we live in a city that both of us grew up in and while he loves it there i’ve always seen myself living somewhere else. this is in large part because i’ve always dreamt of going to medical school. i’ve been working a job now for 2 years as gap years before medical school because i wanted my application to be the best it could possibly be before i applied. he obviously knows about my dream to go to medical school and has been nothing but supportive about it. however, it’s been the elephant in the room when it comes to our relationship. we have never really talked about what life would look like if i were to actually get into med school. i also won’t be applying to medical school until at the earliest mid next year and going the year after. that being said, i know i stand the best chance of getting into medical schools in the state that he and i are both residents in, which does change things. he said the reason why he is breaking up with me is because he doesn’t see how his future and my future line up because of me wanting to go to medical school so he would rather break up now then possibly grow cold and distant or do something that would end up hurting me later. he wanted to let me know that i did nothing wrong and that’s what makes this harder, because our relationship had been nothing but happy. in my shock i really didn’t say much, but i did ask how long he was thinking about this and he said “not long, it’s been something that was gradual but i was really thinking about it the last 2 days”. i can’t help but feel like he woke up one morning and thought to himself “let me blow up my relationship” but he has never been that type of person before. i think what confuses me the most, and what i would love advice on, is the fact that he did all this talking about “our futures” but never once have we ever actually talked about our futures seeing as i am half of it. i’m not saying our relationship wasn’t still going to end after this talk, at this point i will never know, but to be cut out of this conversation completely and the decision made without even a word from me feels disrespectful. it’s like he just gave up on our relationship before it even got hard, that it wasn’t even worth fighting for. if he would have said to me that he feels like in his gut i’m not the one then okay, i can’t get mad at that or change that. but he didn’t. just that my future with medical school doesn’t line up with him so he would rather end it now. i guess i’m just a little confused and hurt by this sudden switch. he has been nothing but a great guy who i wish the absolute best to, but i have no idea why this came out of nowhere right at this moment.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.008501594048884165,0.0010626992561105207,0.09670563230605739,0.0,0.0

"working together post breakup i broke up with my ex a day and a half ago. it was a short but devastating breakup. we loved each other deeply and still do, but had to make the decision for an amicable breakup, because sometimes love isn't enough and you know there's an expiration date to the relationship. we bickered about petty issues, no major fight ever took place but we got upset often, neither of us are toxic individuals by ourselves, we work together and right outside our workplace is where the relationship started and right there is where it ended. we talked a lot, we chatted, laughed, got emotional as well but we decided it was for the best. the thing is i'm now in a spiral of blame and guilting myself, we still talk at work but we have decided to maintain distance until we are in a position to just be friends because both of us made a great and positive impact in each others lives and we want to be there, even if it is a platonic relationship. i'm still upset, we chat at work even post our breakup, but we talk about work stuff and other random things. we couldn't be together because of multiple external things that stressed us out a lot and often was misdirected towards each other. has anyone ever been in a similar situation? how do you cope with this, i still see my ex partner and will keep seeing him at work and that's not maintaining distance. i've been looking for new jobs. but i don't know why there's still a shimmer of hope that maybe things will change, it's completely irrational i know. i've done the whole nine yards and know i just need to give myself time to get over this breakup and accept my ex as not just an ex partner but as an amazing friend. we even gave each other parting gifts. the thing is, even though we were both in the same place, even though we both knew it was coming and came to an amicable separation without any huss or fuss, i see him taking all the steps, since we still chat, my partner told me he deleted all of our photos, he didn't want a reminder of what could be. i didn't. i'm still holding onto some things. i want to take that step as well and move on but i've never been able to and i just sit in grief and give myself time, the distance does the rest. but here distance is not a factor and this troubles me more. maybe switching jobs would work but it's not happening any time soon. there's so many things to come for us, and we decided we'd give each other major life updates and i'm totally in for that. there's important things that i do want to know about. but right now, it's more the feeling of him on the path to reaching a stable place, while i'm barely accepting the fact that we couldn't be together because of a few issues that had nothing to do with us as individuals. it's also the fact that she's got people to talk about this at our workplace. people he's really good with, his family lives by close as well and has a sibling. i don't have any of this and feel kind of alone in the moment. i had moved to this country not very long ago and that's also a factor that might be affecting me. do let me know what you think about this. appreciate anything that can help!",breakup,1,3158.0,605.0,7.5,0.01818181818181818,0.003305785123966942,0.08099173553719008,1.0,0.0

"it’s me not you break up (long) sooo my bf of about 2 months broke up w me a couple days ago & i’m so torn up. he said that he doesn’t like himself right now (hes been wanting to lose weight.) and that he couldn’t give me the type of emotion that a relationship requires. which he is basing of one incident that sort of was the cause of the argument before he ended things. one day he came over and his energy was just so off he didn’t seem like he wanted to be there or like he was happy to see me & i called him out on it. as he was breaking up w me he said he was happy he just doesn’t know why he can’t show it (which confuses me bc that’s the first time i got that bad energy from him) another reason he was down was because of my outfit (per his words) he said he just expects more when we’re going out, which is cool everyone has preferences i didn’t think the outfit was bad for the movies but w/e. what bugged me was we hadn’t seen each other in a couple days prior to this and instead of being happy to be with me and make memories you’re worried about what i’m wearing??? put me off fs. we ended up not talking for a whole day and i’m waiting to see if he put in any effort to try to talk to me or anything bc the argument generated basically from him. it came out later when we were breaking up that he was okay within those 24hrs not talking me. mind you i was checking my phone nonstop waiting for a text or anything. back to the break up he continues to say that i deserve better because he can’t give me that type of emotion i deserve and he can’t give me everything and that he just wants to be alone. he thought he was ready for a relationship but he’s not. ig all the emotions that goes into a relationship was possibly too much while dealing w his one personal mental issues. just a background on the relationship everything was so so sweet. we both were crushing on each other for monthsssssss before we even spoke a word to each other. we both never thought it would have gotten to a relationship bc how long we just oogled each other from afar. honestly i didn’t have too many red flags blaring prior to that day. & honestly i was shocked to be getting dumped bc i didn’t feel the argument was that bad. but we were both crying ugly tears as it was happening and he said he’s not deleting any pictures only bc i said i couldn’t force myself to do it. & he still was calling me baby and all that and said if i need anything he’s always there. he kept apologizing as well and saying his decision has nothing to do w me. i asked him when he’s doing better does he see a place for us together and he said he didn’t want to jinx it. i wrote this to get some thoughts and opinions about this…me personally i don’t ever think the it’s me not you thing is real. & i understand i may never know if he was being genuine but i just feel better talking about it and getting thoughts and opinions and gathering others experiences. i really feel so heartbroken. it hurts even worse bc i’m not angry w him. but also because i feel like i was so in it and into him and he wasn’t. i told him i’ve dealt w mental health issues so i understand and wouldn’t mind being w him through it. (he just said he wants to be alone) maybe he just lost feelings? bc he said in the beginning he said he was finally happy after a long time. maybe he’s self sabotaging?? i really have no clue and that makes it worse. i which he was straight up w me. also he hasn’t deleted our pictures on instagram yet. anyways how’d you guys get over your first heartbreak? (i’m struggling here the day after i could not stop crying and i’ve been thinking abt him nonstop & it makes it 1000x worse bc we work together thankfully not on the same shift but i’m reminded of him everywhere. all the little corners we used to sneak to get a hug or kiss in. the places we caught each others eye for the first time just everything & it hurts so much.)",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.0,0.008631319358816275,0.007398273736128237,0.08508014796547472,5.0,0.0
"break up story 😔 okay so i have been holding this in for a while! basically i 18(m) was dating a girl (19f) since high school (i was like 16 she was 17 at the time) so we've had a series of arguements a lot which is probably why she cheated. so this one day i was going to my class in third period and i get a text from my friend saying she did something with his brother (did the deed with him) and i started to spiral out because i didn't take it well- so i stormed to her and kind of made a scene (i think i was over reacting on that one) and showed her what my friend told me and showed me, and she just started trying to hug me out of nowhere (mind you i was still mad as hell) and i'm trying to get myself to calm down and she's just been trying and trying to get the situation over with. and a few weeks later i asked her why she did it. turns out she did it because he called her a chicken :/ (at that time i forgave her but i was also weak so i took her back, thinking i could change her, foolish young me move of course) fast forward 2 years later i went to her work place for a tour and information session, everything was normal and all that. then a few weeks later i get a call from her checking in on me and she tells me ""i need you to tell (we'll call him steve) steve that we broke up, and i already gathered that she and him were dating. so i told her "" yeah because you and him are dating"" and she tells me ""yeah.. i'm sorry"" and she starts telling me ""i didn't want to hurt you during your birthday month"" (my birthday was june 19th btw!) and she proceeds to start trying to justify why she did it, she said she was lonely (mind you at the time i visited her work place i told her specifically i didn't have my phone so i couldn't actually text her for a while, and the day she called me i got my phone back) and she said i wasn't talking to her and how i wouldn't communicate, mind you i never had my phone at that time! so to end this off i honestly just said ""please don't bother trying to call me back"" i hung up and blocked her number and since then i have been working on myself but one of my coworkers (i'll call her asia) me and her started talking and well we got into a relationship and it's safe to say i believe she is the one for me, she's nice and understanding and she communicates like a honor roll student (basically she is top tier at communicating) and since then i've just enjoyed being with her a lot! so uh i hope you guys enjoyed this sorry it's long- i don't know if anybody is actually gonna read this 😭😭😭but if you do: thank you ‼️‼️‼️‼️",breakup,1,2582.0,522.0,2.0,0.0038314176245210726,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0

"it make zero sense that he didn't fall in love with me. zero. together 6 months. both of us had the same exact obscure hobbies (independently listed on our dating profiles before we even swiped on each other), same quirks, same life goals, everything down to the last detail. emotionally mature, stable jobs, stable living situations, almost in our 30s. knew what we were both looking for and expressed this explicitly: a life partner. we spent those 6 months enjoying all of the obscure hobbies we shared. it was so much fun. it felt like he was falling so deeply in love with me, but we never got to those words. he initiated talk about moving in together next year, we met each other's families, took things very steady and mature. 5 weeks ago he calls and says he does not have the romantic capacity right now, is breaking up with me, doesn't want to try, and doesn't want to reconnect romantically in the future. i foolishly said that the next time we saw each other i was planning to tell him i loved him. he replied that he didn't get to that point with me. huh????? how????? and i know he is not an avoidant because he has been in many long-term relationships and stayed for years even when the other person has had overwhelming issues. i know he was doubting his career/job/family issues and they were getting to him but i cannot help but feel that this was either used as a lie or that he never cared at all because i cannot wrap my head around the fact that he didn't get anywhere near loving me. and i know that sounds shallow, but if you knew the interests we shared and the things he said/did, you'd be as fucking stunned as i am right now. i am the shortest relationship he has ever had where he has been the one to break up. either he lied to me about his reasoning, or he used me as a distraction, or he is really being truthful. but it's hard to see the fucking truth in anything right now. i feel like i lost my chance. it feels like the loss of my life. i've been through breakups before but i have never begged the way i did with him because i thought that was it. it was the first time i'd ever had that ""gut feeling"" about wanting a partner forever, and now i sure as fuck can't even trust myself ever again going forward, let alone other people.",breakup,1,2269.0,431.0,1.0,0.002320185614849188,0.009280742459396751,0.08584686774941995,5.0,0.0
"the stranger god sent to save my soul you know… sometimes, out of nowhere, god sends someone into your life—not to change it completely, but just to remind you that you’re not alone. that your pain is seen, your silence is heard, and your wounds are not invisible. it’s like a small, divine mercy… a gentle touch sent straight from above. not to heal everything… but to ease the weight. to whisper, “i see you.” maybe they’re a stranger. maybe they live thousands of miles away. maybe you’ve never even met them in person. but somehow… their words feel like home. their voice feels like something you’ve known forever. and when you speak to them… you don’t have to explain every scar. they just know. because they’ve been there. they’ve cried the same way. they’ve felt that silent kind of pain that sits on your chest at 3 am. and suddenly, you find yourself opening up without fear… as if you’ve known them for decades, maybe lifetimes. that’s not random. that’s not coincidence. that’s mercy. that’s god showing you: “you’re still human. you’re still worthy of connection. you still have a heart that can feel and be felt.” after everything you’ve been through, in this world that feels more broken by the day, where being “normal” feels like a luxury, where kindness feels rare and connection feels impossible… that one soul— that unexpected person— makes you realize you’re still here. still capable of feeling. still capable of healing. and maybe, just maybe… you’re not as lost as you thought you were.",breakup,1,1509.0,280.0,1.0,0.0035714285714285713,-0.007142857142857143,0.007142857142857143,0.0,0.0

"why does it hurt so much when you’re the one who walked away? i was in a relationship that meant a lot to me. it was my first real experience of love, and we were each other’s “firsts” in many ways. in the beginning, everything felt right. he made an effort—surprised me with little things, checked in often, planned dates, made me feel secure. it felt like we were genuinely building something special. but as time passed, i noticed a shift. he started pulling away—slow replies, less effort, fewer conversations. it felt like i was watching someone slowly stop choosing me. i kept asking him if we were okay, and every time, he’d say yes. and i believed him—because i wanted to believe him. because i loved him enough to think maybe he was just in a rough place. but love shouldn’t feel like begging for attention. and that’s what it became. he kept saying he’d change. he didn’t. i reached a point where i had nothing left to hold onto, and even less to hope for. so i walked away—not because i stopped loving him, but because i finally realized he had stopped loving me a long time ago. and now? now i’m the one left hurting. i’m the one replaying everything in my head. i was the one who let go, but it still feels like i’m the one who got left behind. it’s a different kind of pain when you have to mourn someone who’s still alive—but no longer who they used to be with you.",breakup,1,1380.0,276.0,4.0,0.014492753623188406,0.010869565217391304,0.09420289855072464,2.0,0.0
"post-relationship realization i think the saddest part about losing him was that he truly was the only person that understood me. he fully understood the loneliness i had felt for so long without me even having to explain it cuz he felt it too. he was always there for me and there was no doubt in my heart that he would’ve and would still do absolutely anything to protect me. we broke up for reasons that i wish never fucking happened. i wish he was kinder and didn’t say the things he said at the very end and i wish he realized that he was hurting me. i don’t regret breaking up with him but the loss of his presence has shown me that i have no one else but him. no one else that loves everything about me and makes me feel comfortable as i am without having to change myself to fit in with them. i can’t confide in my parents because are relationship was a secret (i’m brown) and my friends have shown me that they don’t care. i should be able to speak about my problems without someone who is supposed to be my best friend without her visibly acting irritated and disinterested. the thing is though, i wouldn’t even bother her with it consistently, maybe once or twice a couple months. i couldn’t even speak about when we were happy and having fun together with her because she would shut down. the problems within our relationship (which actually lead to the breakup) started in january but her behavior towards us has been for 2.5 years now. idk i guess i didn’t realize how much it bothered me until i stopped opening up about how i felt with anyone but my boyfriend. and i didn’t realize that she didn’t really care until today. i know i’m not a good person and that i’ve made some deep mistakes towards her but i am proud of myself for at least having empathy. of being able to put my own biases out of the way to be there for her no matter what. i just wish that the other people in my life did that for me too. my feelings matter. and the only person who truly cared about me and how i felt is the one person i can’t talk to. what hurts the most is that we can never be friends and he truly was the most bestest friend i’ve ever had in my life. i love my fella.",breakup,1,2174.0,437.0,6.0,0.013729977116704805,0.011441647597254004,0.12585812356979406,0.0,0.0

"potential breakup i (21f) am in a relationship with my boyfriend (22m) since november 2024. i met him when i was in a toxic relationship (5yrs) with my ex (23m) who cheated so much that i felt nothing towards the last 6 months (i found his s** tape). so when my current partner met me, he promised to give me better and i believed him and at first i did not get into the relationship for the right reasons, but i ended up loving him so much within just a few days. for context he never dated before, i’m his first girlfriend and he made the first move and when i started to feel a lot for him within like three days, he got rude and he would always say things that would hurt and i was like where was this when you were pursuing me? maybe i gave in too easy…but i promise he gave me and said i deserve better. cut to now, i look back and remember countless times when he made me feel like i’m so difficult and try to break up multiple times and i held us together and sometimes i just feel like everything was so forced… and for nearly 2 years i make the first move for everything. and there’s really no safety net. well last night he tried to break up again because we met after a long time and i was very anxious. he said he does not have the wavelength to cater to my emotions and he referred to himself as a reductionist and he says i deserve better and that broke me because i did not expect it and for the past one month i have had severe depression. i cry myself to sleep and i wake up crying because i found out that he is watching porn. we are sexually active in the relationship. so that hurt and he promised to never go there again and he did say that it was a one time thing and i think i have proof for that so i believe it. but i have been trying to get over this but it is taking so long and the solution has been put on hold for the longest time because he had his assignments and his exams and so it took a whole month and finally it’s his holiday it’s been like four days and god knows how much i waited for his holidays only for him to say let’s break up because i am clearly unhealed from the pain he caused. when we meet things arel because i’m so anxious. i will keep asking for reassurance and it can get exhausting but then i feel like after so long he should know how to meet me in the middle and not use being a reductionist as an l excuse to not grow. however, yesterday morning before the whole wake up thing which happened at night it is important to note that i cried the previous night and he knew about it and so he promised that he will come and see me once his parents travel a lot more and that gave me so much hope, that was the happiest i’ve ever been in the safest i’ve ever felt and then that midnight is when he initiated the break up after we had an argument… so i literally told him that i have waited for a whole month in the same state just for these holidays of yours to come and four days and you break up with me so it’s like my perseverance was for nothing. i asked him to give us one chance at least because we have been good but then he’s so pessimistic. he’s like no even when we’re good there’s problems and i had to tell him and convince him that every relationship can have problems, it’s how you bounce back from them that matters and i feel like i’m selling the idea of why he should give it a chance to him and that is so demeaning and right now i’m constantly calling him and he just talks like he has no interest and he acts like everything is fine now because he accepted giving it another try but i just feel like i’m a beggar in this relationship because when i stepped into this relationship, i did not expect this power dynamic. i really thought that he wanted me first and that is what it will always be like but then within a few days of starting the relationship the power dynamic completely switched as if i got scammed after i gave up everything to be with him. i want to leave, but i have an immense and intense fear of abandonment. it affects my health and i genuinely have no time in my life at the moment to go through a break up so i wanted to detach and leave because i give a lot of love and he admitted to that he said i’m very loving and he can’t match my love, which i honestly think it’s just weaponise and competence so please could you all give me suggestions and for context i have hobbies that i want to practice so i can get over this but nothing helps when it comes to my heart. tl;dr: don’t know how tl;dr works but i’m assuming it’s a summary? basically, my boyfriend wants to end the relationship because he says i deserve better but i have invested so much and i’m not ready and so it hit me like a shock and i have still held this together and he tried multiple times to break up through the relationship and he just can’t handle any relationship stress almost as if you got into this relationship because he found me attractive not because he actually wanted a proper relationship with depth.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.015810276679841896,-0.0009881422924901185,0.09782608695652174,2.0,0.0

"finally made up my mind me (23m) and my girlfriend (23f) have been together for 2 years, we met at university and have been long distance for the past year, we live about 4 hours from each other. for the past year the plan has always been for her to move up to where i live. she has been fairly vocal about being very worried about it, as i live in a big city and she’s grown up in a small town. i began having doubts in the past few months about our compatibility and life goals. i’m very career driven and want to do really well. as opposed to her who has been working in her home town, but despite for a year having the knowledge of moving to me, has not applied for a single job in the area. she hasn’t even looked. she was meant to be moving in with me next weekend, however, this has been postponed due to the death of her grandfather, earlier this week, whom she was very close with and lived with. originally i wanted to see how it would go with us living together in the hope maybe things changed and we became more compatible and she would start applying for jobs and enjoy living here. after the tragedy her family has been through i can no longer in good conscience have her move up here. it would be so much more awful and upsetting if i let her move out of fear of breaking up with her now, to then break up with her in 3 months when she’s moved half way across the country. i’ve made up my mind, i need to breakup with her soon. but i just feel like the most awful person. why couldn’t i have decided this 2 months ago before her grandad died? when she wasn’t already in pain. she’s talking about still moving here in a few weeks, so i need to break up with her soon. i think once the funerals and everything are out the way i’ll have to do it. i deeply care about her and love her, but i know we just aren’t right for each other. we just want different things. i don’t think she sees this coming at all. i’m praying part of her feels the same way. but i think she’s going to be completely blindsided by this, and it’s going to make an already down and grieving girl so much more hurt. but i feel like i don’t have a choice, i either do it now while the death of her grandfather is still fresh. or i let her move here, let more time settle then break up with her and make her move back home, which i know will be worse. i just feel so awful, but i know what i have to do.",breakup,1,2386.0,491.0,5.0,0.010183299389002037,0.004073319755600814,0.0814663951120163,1.0,0.0

"advice hey, i broke up with my ex back in october, and i just wanted to give everyone some advice who just got out of a relationship and is feeling heartbroken. it gets easier. i know it’s something you’re sick of hearing and something you just can’t ever imagine but believe it or not it does get easier. and i wont lie to you and say that you’ll completely forget that person, no you’ll always remember them. but by time you’ll just learn to live with those memories and be unaffected by it. so please whatever it is whatever you’re doing understand that you can’t rush into anything and just give urself time to grieve, be angry or whatever you feel like doing but by time you will feel better they always regret it. if you broke up with your partner because they did you wrong whether it’s cheating or just disrespect, they always regret it. it might not happen instantly, but it sure happens sooner than you think. and when it does happen you’ll finally be at peace with yourself knowing that yes it might be a small step but it’s a good step to actually help you move on my last and final thing i want to say what alot of you might not agree on, is to forgive. yes you might even get pissed off or angry about the thought of forgiving someone that did you wrong. but trust me it feels better. forgiving doesn’t mean forgetting what happened and just going back to normal. no forgiving means to just come to peace with everything. yes they cheated, yes they disrespected, yes they broke your heart. you’ve finally learnt to accept that and move on from your life. forgiving doesn’t happen quick you don’t have to forgive now or tomorrow or anytime sooner, you do it and your own pace. but if you ever decide to do so just trust me it feels relieving. but it’s just advice so take it as a grain of salt. these are the stuff i wanted to say i broke up with my ex a few months ago, and now i feel better than ever i feel happier in life, i feel like i got closer with my friends and just started enjoy every single thing that happens. i hope everyone reading this wakes up one day and just starts feeling slightly better than the day before.",breakup,1,2143.0,422.0,7.5,0.02132701421800948,0.011848341232227487,0.04265402843601896,0.0,0.0

"my ex with likely bpd traits ended things harshly — now she wants to come back a few months ago, my ex ended our relationship with a cold, final message — telling me i wasn’t a relationship person and that i wasn’t her person. it was shocking, given how much i had shown up for her and how hard i’d worked to keep us afloat during some very difficult times. but deep down, i knew the relationship had become unsustainable. there were repeated cycles of emotional volatility — fights that escalated quickly, intense accusations, rewriting of history, and a pattern where i was often made to feel like the bad guy no matter how carefully i tried to communicate. over time, i began to suspect she might have undiagnosed borderline personality disorder. the extreme black-and-white thinking, fear of abandonment, and emotional intensity were all there. i say this with compassion: i don’t believe she wanted to hurt me, but the impact was real — i was walking on eggshells, constantly trying to prevent the next explosion. after she ended things, i focused on healing. i didn’t reach out. i grieved, went to therapy, tried to rebuild some stability. and then, weeks ago, she reached out again with a long, emotional message. she told me she now realizes how much pain she caused, how often she misdirected her anger, and how unfair she was to me. she said she misses me and wants another chance. but alongside the emotional message, she also started asking for random items back — including things she had previously gifted me, some of which weren’t even particularly meaningful to me (like items from her old boss). i ended up coordinating two separate uber courier trips to return everything. i haven’t replied to the emotional part of her message. i told her i couldn’t give her an answer right now. i don’t know what to make of it. part of me still loves her, and wonders if this is genuine growth. but i’m also deeply afraid of going back into the same emotionally chaotic cycle — even if she says she sees it now. if you’ve been through a breakup with someone who might have bpd traits, did they ever come back with real change? did you try again — and how did you know whether to trust it?",breakup,1,2192.0,398.0,4.0,0.010050251256281407,-0.002512562814070352,0.08040201005025126,2.0,0.0
"i need advice. my ex [23m] betrayed me in a deeply personal way, and years later i [25f] still feel haunted. is it wrong to want to reach out — just once? this happened a few years ago, but it still lives in me in a way i haven’t been able to shake. he wasn’t my first love, but he was my first love. we were young — early college years — mostly long-distance, but very deeply connected. or so i believed. he made me feel like i was his dream girl, like there was no one in his past, present, or future who could compare. toward the end of our relationship, he left me for his ex — someone who, i later learned, was more palatable to his very religious family (my family is religious too, just more on the moderate side). their relationship didn’t last either though. over time, i fell in love again — multiple times. so did he. we’re both in long-term, committed relationships now. and we haven’t spoken in years. and yet… i still carry it. what broke me wasn’t just that he left me. we stayed in contact for sometime and were honestly compatible even as friends. we've always had great chemistry and liked a lot of the same things. it was what i found out afterward that killed me, through a mutual friend: he had shared intimate photos of me with people in his life. his friends. i never confronted him. i just removed him from my social media (the ones that count at least) and cut him off. he never reached out. never asked why. never apologized. and sometimes, i wonder if he even knows that i know. i wonder all the time, did he do it because he was just a child (he really was), or because he was and maybe still is just a horrible human being? and it's that question that leaves room in my heart to give him the benefit of the doubt. i’ve tried to give myself closure. i’ve journaled, processed, forgiven. and in many ways, i’ve healed. i’ve built a life i’m proud of — a career, a partner i respect, a community. a life he never touched. but there’s still this ache — a quiet, confusing mix of grief, disbelief, and, yes, longing. not for reconciliation. just for acknowledgment. to be seen. to be remembered. to be heard. i know most people in my position wouldn’t give someone like that another second of thought. but i’ve prayed for it, ached for it, all this time. not to relive the past — just to close the chapter with both eyes open. now here’s the hard part: i’m traveling to his city soon. not for him — it’s just coincidence. i won’t call it fate. but it feels significant. like the window i never had. i don’t expect a real, life-changing, heartfelt conversation. i don’t want a reunion. i just want to say — one time — i know what you did. i’ve grown. i forgave you even when you didn’t deserve it. and i hope you found what you were looking for. is that wrong? is it delusional to want to be remembered by someone who hurt you? is it selfish to need that last sliver of being seen — even after everything? i know silence is the dignified way out. but it still pulls at me. and i’m tired of carrying this quietly. tired of biting my tongue. tired of always being the bigger person, hoping it’ll give us both peace.",breakup,1,3136.0,611.0,7.0,0.011456628477905073,0.004909983633387889,0.09328968903436989,5.0,0.0

"looking back with embarrassment at what i allowed myself to obsess over i have given up with the idea that we will ever get back together. i struggled with the breakup for months on end. he explained with many excuses that the reason we needed to break up is because he just couldn’t be in a relationship, he was busy, how i deserved better (he admitted on his own accord he no longer hung out or went on dates with me, didn’t remember my birthday, etc) and because of his actions that’s why he couldn’t be romantically attracted anymore. at the time it all made no sense to me. i was way busier than him yet still made time for him, meanwhile he was out nearly everyday with friends yet only could see me once a week. how could someone say the reason they no longer want you is because they treat you bad? how do you recognize you treat me bad yet your answer is to discard of me when you could just be better?? he was the one to ask me to be his girlfriend. he pursued me first. he was really sweet and romantic at the start of the relationship. he went above and beyond on dates and was so kind. if he wasn’t attracted why did he bother pursuing me? i even met all his friends and family. what was the point if he was just going to ditch me after a few months? then, it turns out he got a new girlfriend. this solidified every bit of closure i needed. it’s simple, he just didn’t like me. i obsessed over this breakup. i let it eat me alive. i let it control my mind at every waking moment for months because i was so hopelessly in-love. he was my first boyfriend too. yet he dropped me and moved on within no time. he has so many friends to keep him company and support him. i had to rebuild up from absolutely nothing but even his friends said i could do better. it gnaws at me how much i humiliated myself by dating him. and even allowing myself to get to this point where i was obsessed over a guy who didn’t even care if i lived or died. this has me seriously questioning everything i think i built up in terms of self esteem, self worth, self respect. my pride and ego are completely shattered. i begged someone to love me, at which they rejected several times. i don’t even know how to heal my pride from here. i have dishonored myself horribly. i don’t even want to get back together. i want to regain back all the dignity i lost.",breakup,1,2341.0,467.0,7.0,0.014989293361884369,0.017130620985010708,0.09850107066381156,5.0,0.0

"she called me “sick” for loving her. i feel like i'm stabbed but i'm not bleeding.. i was in a relationship with a girl for 9 months from may 2024 to january 2025. she had thoughts, ideas and interests that matched mine in a rare way. she said i love you and showed hypersexual signs to me but i like it anyway she was perfect to me someone i could build a life with and she felt like home … she changed. her replies got dry. she stopped showing emotion. she was accusing me of cheating but she made it to look like she is joking and doesn't give a f*ck about long or deep talks anymore.. so i stepped back and gave her space. then in march, i watched a movie that touched my heart..it reminded me of her ...of us it was about fate and i was believing that the fate will get us again perfectly together cause we are soulmates in my mind. so i texted her and she ignored me. i was romantic. i felt hopeless, but i kept trying from april up until yesterday i tried to get back the connection at least i need to be a good person to her if she was thinking that i am a cheater i need to clear my name yesterday felt like a bullet hit my head... a guy texted me told me that he is her fiancé and i better never try to talk to her again it crushed me... i felt angry i couldn’t understand how someone i imagined forever with could move on like i never mattered so i texted her. not to beg — but to tell her how the past few months felt and how surprised i am by her treatment of me i even told her if she had just been honest and told me she was seeing someone else, i would’ve backed off and not trying to get her again and then… she replied. she called me sick. said i was crazy, annoying, and that she doesn’t respect me anymore for what i am sending to her and i should have left her alone when she didn't reply to my text messages and i am not different than others that bother random girls.. what the hell i am reading.. i felt a stranger not a lover boy not anymore she said she “respects her new guy now” and doesn’t want to cause problems in her relationship. and to make sure i did read it she copy-pasted the same harsh message on both whatsapp and instagram then she blocked me i’m full of anger, humiliation, and grief — not just because i lost her, but because the perfect love story i was building in my mind disappeared in a blink. she turned my love into something shameful. she made it feel like a curse. a weakness. a disease that she can't handle how could someone showed love, passion and sex turn so heartless? to be brutally cruel to someone loves her truly i still don’t get it. but i needed to get this out.",breakup,1,2626.0,526.0,1.0,0.0019011406844106464,0.009505703422053232,0.11787072243346007,1.0,0.0

"does it get better?? it’s been exactly a month since the break up. we were together throughout highschool since freshman year, broke up right before graduation. she was upset that i wasn’t prioritizing her, but i was so busy working to keep myself afloat that i became distant from her, not because i wanted to but because i had no energy for anyone, not even myself. unfortunately we talked about it too late, i tried to fix things. god knows i tried, but she said she was too hurt by how i had acted and she didn’t know what she wanted to do, after weeks of trying, i told her i understood if she didn’t want to be together, she said thank you and that’s the last time we talked. she was my very first everything first love first kiss anything you can think of, we were beyond happy together, we talked about how many kids we wanted, their names, where we were gonna grow old together, what type of house, i never imagined a future without her. she was my everything. towards the last six months of the relationship it did get choppy, because i was working sm, i communicated less, so i guess i can see how she felt, i’m just really hurt. the worst part is that i quit that job a few weeks before the break up, i was so excited to finally dedicate time to her, i was planning dates and things and everything. it pains me i was ready to dedicate sm time to her now i’m alone. now i’m in my room alone listening to the smiths drowning in my sorrows, i’m just thinking does it get better??? every night has just been full of regret and pain, can anyone tell me if it gets better??? will i always feel this pain??? i’ve never felt pain like this, is this just life? i’m just lost and confused right now",breakup,1,1700.0,337.0,4.0,0.011869436201780416,-0.002967359050445104,0.11572700296735905,5.0,0.0

"5 weeks dating, blew it, when you know, you know. 30m, after a four week whirlwind of dating someone new and falling hard for each other, i blew it. context is important here: * ex-wife divorced me under a year of being married and over 8 years together. * she had bpd and a range of issues, i also ran out of patience and lost emotional bandwidth to deal with them. * she developed emotional affair. asked for divorce, and then proceeded to bang the guy she told me not to worry about. * mentally, this broke me right up, a bunch of trust issues, feelings of emasculation, and a bunch of trauma that i worked through over the next 18 months, or so i thought. * we still kept in contact, me thinking i was taking the high ground, in reality i've come to realise i was stuck in a horrific trauma-loop. where i was so embarrassed about the situation, the constant calls and my stuck feelings of duty to this person that i would hide behind false-justifications: 'we're just friends', it's fine there's no issue between us, i want the best for her, and it takes maturity to move on past divorce and formulate a friendship - even to write this infuriates me. enter new woman: * an amazing soul with immense emotional maturity and personal growth. * hyper-independent, someone who didn't necessarily need me, but wanted to spend time with me. * great conversations, similar interests, off-the charts s\*xual chemistry. * someone who appreciated all of the parts of me that i was insecure about. * someone who i realised, was enough for me to change my behaviours with my ex (yes reddit i know i should have done this a long time ago, hence unhealed). * this new woman, was the perfect match for me in every single aspect, when you know, you know. the issues * i subconsciously wasn't paying attention to the significance of keeping in contact with my ex. i was stuck in a loop of an unhealed trauma bond and as a result, downplayed the seriousness of the situation to the new girl because i knew if she found out the truth she'd think less of me. this fear of rejection and anxiety i understand stems from an unhealthy need for approval, which i never received in my marriage. * i told her that the ex and i were just friends, and i didn't see anything wrong with calls with my ex every other couple of days. this was 'normal' to me. i recognise this was my co-dependency, falling into the same habits and routine, not for a desire to get back together with her, but because i was addicted to the highs and lows of the control she had over me. * ultimately i was so entangled in my brain i'd convinced myself that this was perfectly normal, my ex-wife was my first everything, so even breaking up was new for me. * i made the decision to stay in contact, full well knowing it was unhealthy because i was ignorant. as frustrating as it is to admit, all the counselling and self-development work aside. i didn't have the guts to go no-contact with my ex. the conflict * i projected onto the new girl that this wasn't going to be an issue. yet i constantly brought up my ex-wife and the 'friendship' as if the new girl needed constant reassurance. in reality this was me self-justifying. * i mislead the new girl into thinking that the friendship i had with the ex wasn't serious. whereas in reality i now see speaking every few days is unhealthy as well. * i didn't ask to break of the communication with the ex until after i met the new girl. this all came to a head after i was vulnerable in sharing with the new girl that the ex and i were no-contact and i felt like a massive weight was lifted off my shoulders. * new girl asked a bunch of questions about: how often were we in contact (every few days), prior to a week ago when communication was cut, what were the types of conversations we were having (how's the shared pet, work going), when the last time we slept together was (8 weeks ago). * the above lead to her expressing her upset over the fact i was still basically in a relationship that hadn't been severed, even though i had no intention to get back with my ex (the sex was a once off, discussed, drunken mistake, prior to meeting new girl). * she then explained that she felt manipulated and mislead, that i downplayed the constant communication with my ex (i did), and it's made her question everything about the relationship we'd formed. what i've learned * i was in an unhealthy, unhealed trauma bond with my ex wife. i am disappointed in myself for the new relationship being a freaking awful lesson in self-development and healing. * do not get into something new, thinking that you can heal yourself at the same time. even though the divorce was my first breakup, i didn't know how to act. i'm learning to forgive myself that the unhealthy pattern i was stuck in wasn't normal. * i should have been more honest with myself about the unhealthy level of communication i had with my ex wife. i knew i didn't want to have it, i didn't have the maturity to speak up about it. * i caught the new girl in the crossfire, and she didn't deserve that. she didn't need to hear any of this in the first place, i could have elected to not say anything at all. my insecurities and trauma just overshared so early on inside this new relationship, and i hurt her badly. reflection: * the new girl has asked for time and space to process all of this. ultimately we've only been together for 5 weeks, but 3-4 times per week has made things move fast. * this is a core boundary of hers that i feel i've crossed by misleading her about the situation. * i have taken the steps to continue with therapy, and acknowledge my own issues with the fact that i was unhealed. * no-contact is so peaceful without constantly having to worry about being called by my ex. i feel like i can finally heal. * new girl and i had same mutual feelings for each other, and everything else aligned in terms of what we wanted to do / be together. i need advice * i do believe that falling on my sword here is the fairest outcome. this new girl deserves peace and love from someone that is fully-healed. regardless of how strong we felt about each other. * as much as it pains me to ask, can anyone offer insight into how to heal from a trauma bond outside of the normal therapist-style input? * can anyone also offer some words of wisdom? i have dated a few people over the last two years, but in my entire lifetime i've only fallen in love and connected with 2 women. how do you navigate the feelings of fear that your luck has run out? * i want to do my healing and learn

"appetite, sleep and more i broke up 3 days ago. ohh god it hurts so much. i did a lot of research and realised that my partner has an avoidant attachment style and i have anxious attachment style. damn me, i never tried to look into that while we were dating. thursday she came to pick me up for a weekend together. everything was packed and ready and boom she announced it. we had no such fights or arguments in months so it was really unexpected. we were together for 14 months. i dont want to get back to her and i am fine with the breakup. i am meeting her today to collect my stuff from her place. i am a bit anxious seeing her. anyways, i am in the situation where i feel hungry but dont feel like eating anything. sometimes i would even cook but as soon as its ready, i will throw that in the bin. i fall asleep easily but end up waking up in few hours with really bad thoughts and wouldnt be able to fall back asleep. today i woke up 3.30am and its 6.30 while i m writing this. can anyone suggest me some ideas to help me sleep a little longer. also what do you guys to to keep your peace of mind in such situations. what helps you? give me some ideas.",breakup,1,1160.0,229.0,3.0,0.013100436681222707,-0.008733624454148471,0.1091703056768559,1.0,0.0
"adhd ruined my relationship i ruined my relationship 3 months ago because i had undiagnosed adhd and absolutely tormented my ex. initially lying about stuff and then impulsively going through her phone, which eroded her trust and caused her to check out. i became codependent. she monkeybranched to a new relationship with a coworker. i chased and obsessed over her this last month, previously giving her space and keeping limited contact because we were both studying for finals and my behavior in the first month post breakup was horrible and i didn’t want to act like that anymore. when i last saw her two days ago i apologized for my behavior, being a bad partner and how it cost us our relationship and that if she ever felt differently that she should let me know. her reply was a somber “okay.” i found out about my adhd induced codependency just a few hours ago and do not know what to do. there’s nothing more i can say or do to get her back now. how can i ever reconcile with her? she was nigh-perfect. i plan to work on getting my life in order and reach out a few months later down the line.",breakup,1,1103.0,206.0,3.0,0.014563106796116505,0.0,0.10679611650485436,1.0,0.0

"are men really this ridiculous? me and my boyfriend of 8 months recently broke up and i'm so confused. i'm literally so hurt over it and it's so weird bc i was compeltely fine when we actually broke up. i missed him and wanted to give him another chance the same day i officially broke things off, but i didn't bc i knew it was the right thing to just continue off without him. he's so selfish, and childish, like really we couldn't continue this relationship bc he needed me to be his girlfriend but also be in check of all of his emotions and entire life (like i'm literally only one person) so after our third breakup i just decided to end things. things were fine, i felt kinda free and i found my peace again. until i found out he got with the same girl that i was worried he was cheating on me with/lying about during our breakup??? now nothing fucking makes sense. he tried so many times to get back together with me, to each time i kept denying and saying no... and tried so hard for days to get back together wtih me and give him a chance just to turn around adn do this shady shit behind my back?? it literally makes no fucking sense. anyway, since finding out they're together i've been extremely depressed. i was relatively sad after the breakup but it wasn't as intense as how i've feeling for the past week. all i want to do is reach back out to him and reconstruct things, but i know it's wrong. i truly miss him but at the same time i don't want anything to do with him. he completely broke my trust by lying about the relationship he had with a girl he knew i was worried about when we were still kinda together, and i don't know if i'm allowed to even be mad because well, we're not dating.. but you know, that's fucking shady. we just broke up, and he's already in another relationship as if the one we worked so hard to preserve meant absolutely nothing. i'm fucking broken, i'm genuinely so depressed and i go to bed thinking of him, have constant dreams of him, and then wake up thinking about him too. when i go out in public, almost everything reminds me of him. it's as if i'm being haunted by him and i fucking hate it. all i want is to forget about him, and all of this, and to know nothing more about him or his life ever again. like truly it's all so crazy to me, his rls before mine was literally insane and she cheated on him at every chance she got, yet with me i was overly loyal and he was still traumatized/scared which was reasonable but sometimes it genuinely felt like he couldn't trust me at all which was so weird because i really did try my hardest to give him a safe space and let him know he can trust me. but, for him to pull this shady shit, of all people? like fuck youuuu wtf😭 but can anyone help me like get over him and at least let me know that his new relationship isn't some shit i should worry about. honestly i feel he doesn't rlly love her and that his lust got the best of him and he just with another girl to be with a girl, given he just got together with her and they literally met a few weeks ago bye.. but i really just want to forget about him, and i hate him so much but also really miss him and the bond we had. we were really good friends and i wish we could've stayed friends because he was a cool ass guy n we had a shit ton in common, but knowing i can't even like be his friend anymore hurts me too, even though i hate him and hope he fuckin burns 😭. lastly, it really hurts that i have absolutely no one to turn to. i feel like my friends and mom are kinda tired of me constantly talking about this, and i only have one or two friends to talk to anyway and they don't have a lot to say. my mom is really sweet and notices how depressed i am and i rlly hate being so depressed about it. i want to go back to normal and be happy but it just feels like i can't, and i don't want to be depressed all summer anymore. my birthday's next week so i can try to enjoy that at least. but that's probably why i miss him so much. we talked, all day, every single day, about everything. now, i have no one to share my stories with. no one to talk about my day with. no one to update about anything, no one to show my hauls, nobody. i truly need more friends lol. i never realized just how little friendships i had until i lost him, and realizing that i lost the only person who actively checked in on me hurts like hell!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but i think im mostly depressed because he stayed with me through my entire, busy, crazy school year where i barely had time to spend with him, and now that i do have the time of course we're broken up. now that i have time to do any and everything, i have no one to do it with and no one to talk to. that definitely hurts the most paired with knowing i can't reconstruct our friendship at the very least.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.020021074815595362,0.003161222339304531,0.10010537407797682,5.0,0.0

"how do i make myself ‘want to move on’. two months ago my ex broke up with me for good, she tried a week before that but i managed to persuade her to do a break instead as she was very overwhelmed and burnt out (we are both autistic), and i wanted to work on our issues together and do better, not break up. during the break she said she wanted to no contact for a ‘few days’ and then ignored me for a week, whilst i was going frantically researching healthy relationships and autism, adhd, attachment theory, trying to find solutions to our problems and our issues. i found alot, and learnt alot about being a better partner. i realised that i needed to primarily empathise and ask ‘how did you feel’ when i make a mistake to deliver a real apology etc. (i would put emphasis on explaining that i didn’t intend to hurt them) (alot of our arguments were to do with me being blunt and honest, and her also perceiving things as criticism which were not). anyways, after the ‘few days’ the no contact continued and i started to wonder if she would ever respond, and eventually after a week of me going almost insane, she broke up with me over text, giving the usual faux reasoning ‘work on myself’, ‘focus on career’, ‘being hurt’ etc. 3 weeks prior she said i was her autistic favourite person alongside her mum. i respected her wishes, and wished her the best, although i said i was upset at her for doing it over text. i then reached out after a few days seeking closure and understanding how i had hurt her, i presumed it was my blunt manner. silence. i repeated breaking no contact many times, as i genuinely believed she was the loml, and had so many great qualities and we got along so well in person, and i really believed we could’ve worked through our minor issues. we just had poor conflict resolution, prevention, and she held resentment towards me. she is the first person i have ever met that i really thought i could marry (i am very picky), and i am so confused as to why she ignored me after i sent her a letter apologising taking accountability after i learnt about mistakes i may have made, reached out for closure, reached out to ask how she felt, reached out to ask how my mistakes made her feel, say sorry etc. silence. i don’t understand why she would do this. she is also an fa leaning avoidant, and i am either an anxious, or fa leaning anxious. i had to block her after 2 weeks of being ignored to prevent myself from reaching out to give her space, which i explained in order to not confuse her and show it was my lack of temperance that led me to block her, not her behaviour. then i unblocked her as i said i would once i had felt i could control my emotions and not reach out when upset or wanting to take accountability/check in etc. it has been 2 months since we split, 5-6 weeks since i blocked her, 3 weeks since i unblocked her. her birthday is in a week and a half, i feel i have to make a choice, i also want to let her know that i still want to give her a proper apology and understand how i hurt her with my blunt words. i am really really heartbroken and confused, and i don’t know what to do or how to help myself move on, because i don’t want to move on.",breakup,1,3193.0,614.0,7.5,0.02280130293159609,-0.008143322475570033,0.11726384364820847,0.0,0.0
"should i move on or rebuild? 21m and 21f. completely shattered. hey reddit, this is gonna be long, but i seriously need some unbiased perspectives. me (21m) and my ex (21f), both indians, were in a relationship for 1 year and 4 months. it was deep. it was real. we weren’t just boyfriend and girlfriend — we planned *everything* together. from naming our future kids, to our careers, to even building startups together. our entire lives were woven around each other. but two weeks back, things crumbled. it started because i failed to show up for her during a really stressful day (her boarding a train alone and later her internship prep). i was genuinely sick but looking back, i do realize i should’ve been there emotionally, at least through calls. that moment planted hurt in her that i didn’t realize grew this big. fast forward, last wednesday, she told me the love is gone. said she doesn’t feel the same anymore. even told me brutal stuff like — *“even if we married, i’d probably cheat on you. i wouldn’t even want to sleep in the same bed.”* — hearing that from someone who once called me *‘my hubby’* every day absolutely destroyed me. i’m not gonna sugarcoat it — i’m an emotional guy. i loved her with everything. the late-night calls, the morning texts, the teasing, the intimacy — everything felt like home. now, her signal profile (we shifted to signal to have our own private space) feels like a graveyard of memories. photos, chats, our startup plans — all just sitting there haunting me. my parents are secretly relieved that we broke up. even some of her friends seem okay with it. but me? i still love her. deeply. but also… i’m terrified. terrified of getting back and ending up broken again. she gave up once. what if she does it again? she asked for time until monday — to decide whether she wants to rebuild or cut everything off for good. part of me wants her back like crazy. part of me screams to walk away because i deserve better than being an option. i’m stuck. badly. if she says *“i need time”* on monday, i’m confused about whether i should accept that or just close the chapter permanently. if she says *“let’s rebuild”* — should i even trust that? or am i signing up to get hurt again? the pain of imagining her doing the things we did — kissing, cuddling, even being physically intimate — with someone else someday is honestly tearing me to pieces. but i also know that’s not a reason to stay where i’m not wanted. just wanna know from those who’ve been through this: → is love after it’s broken ever the same? → is giving time healthy or just prolonging the pain? → am i being stupid for still hoping? any advice. any perspective. anything. i’ll take it. **ps: i’m not asking reddit to decide for me. i just wanna hear how others see this. i know the decision has to be mine.** **thank you if you read this far. seriously.**",breakup,1,2863.0,525.0,4.0,0.007619047619047619,0.0038095238095238095,0.10285714285714286,5.0,0.0
"i 39m feel bad about the way i am initiating break up with my gf 38f, but i feel it’s necessary. me - 39m gf - 38f together for 3 years tldr: i feel bad about the way i’m breaking up with my girlfriend of 3 years. i’ve got my small amount of furniture ( couch, grill, dresser ) to be sold on monday while she is at work, have a breakup text written up, and will sell my things, pack my car, send the text and be gone before she gets home. i hate to do it this way, but she can be very emotionally unstable, and has put me in very compromising positions in the past ( calling police to get me in trouble over no wrongdoing ) and very easily loses control with no boundaries when emotionally triggered. it isn’t how i prefer to handle this, but i feel, for my safety, safe passage and right to do with my property ( furniture ) what i choose, i must handle the breakup covertly to assure no attempts are made at me to damage me in one way or the other on my way out the door. i’m going to try to condense this as much as possible to avoid writing a novel. i’m trying to understand if the way i’m choosing to break up with my girlfriend is extremely shitty, or understandably justified. long story short, we just aren’t compatible in a number of really important ways. financially, parenting, values. but i think above all else, i simply cannot work through the emotional instability from her side any longer. we honestly have 2 different relationships that i’m essentially in with two different people. one side of her, she’s sweet and nice, amicable and a pleasure to spend time with. on the other side, she is a nasty nasty person, who is mean, abusive, manipulating and damaging. and she turns into this person at the flip of a switch. the other night, i was given a half of a protein bar at work, it was a wafer type bar, not very filling. her daughter asked me what it was when i got home, i told her, and i proceeded to eat half of it before dinner. mind you, i was absolutely starving, and this little bit of food did not affect my appetite at all. my gf had just cooked dinner and i planned to ( and did ), eat an entire large plate, which was very good. however, once she saw me eating the half of the protein bar, she got visibly upset, and started throwing me an attitude about me eating that just prior to eating dinner. i understood where she was coming from, and i assured her that i was still very hungry, and that i had full intentions on eating a full plate of food for dinner. but this is where things normally go haywire, instead of that moment happening, and being resolved and over with, as i mentioned, i still ate a full plate of dinner, she proceeded to go on a multi day personality flip stemming from this one moment. she turned into the rude, cold, short mannered, distant, unloving and intermittently disrespectful person she turns into over any singular thing that sends her spiraling. she finally snapped out of it this morning on day 3, when i declined to go on a planned event to the springs that we had planned all weekend, because i was just tired of being treated poorly, and when bringing it up to her last night, she proceeded to finish the crappy convo on her end with” i’ll just see you when i get home tomorrow “ essentially disinviting me from our set plans that we’ve had for a week now, all because i’ve been hurt and upset at how she’s been treating me since the “protein bar” incident. she basically told me, if you know i’m this person and you know i’m not going to care when you bring this up to me about how i’m acting, then why do you waste your time in doing so. so this morning, i declined to go, and once she left the house, and i was not with her, it’s typically things like this that “snap” her back into reality and her feet come back down to earth and she checks back in. she started texting me, pleading with me to come, but i declined. she’s been checked back in ever since, and been nice all day. but unfortunately the timer has just begun for the next event 3-4 days from now that will send her spiraling again, and we will continue this jykll and hyde relationship where it feels like i’m with two different people. so, back to the main reason for this post. i plan to break up with her on monday. i have a friend that has said i can come stay with them, and i have my couple items of furniture set to be sold and picked up on monday during the day while she is at work ( couch, grill, dresser ) ( i’m leaving my other very nice dresser for her daughter and leaving my queen bed set for her son ), and have a text written up to her to send once the items are sold and my car is packed. i’ve already got the rest of my items ready to go, i’ve went through the house and gathered all my things, and have them set aside in the garage in a non conspicuous way. i feel crappy doing the breakup like this, but i cannot trust the crazy side of her. the part of her that gets triggered to the mean version of her, is scary. she’s called the police on me before for absolutely nothing, tells me things like our daughter isn’t mine and that she cheated on me and got pregnant, takes my phone from me, shuts my phone line off so i can’t use it, locks me out of the house so i can’t get it, and just isn’t someone i can trust at all when things aren’t going well. i feel the only certain option that i have to be able to properly take care of the things that are rightfully mine, peacefully gather my belongings, and avoid a potentially messy breakup convo are to do it this way. the thing is, i feel bad, because i don’t want to hurt the girl that is much more kind ( compatibility issues aside ), but i honestly have no idea which version of her i’ll be dealing with, and the “not nice” version of her is, simply put, ruthless and fucking crazy. just looking for some perspective on this and was curious of everyone’s thoughts on how i’m going to proceed with initiating the “break up”.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.01293103448275862,0.0017241379310344827,0.0939655172413793,0.0,0.0
"will he regret it? i think i would believe he would regret breaking up with me more if im not afraid of the girl he got with immediately after is going to treat him better not that i treated him bad just that he likes her more than me and is glad he left me. but i dont know. i really really believed that he'd regret this one day way more strongly in the beginning but i think as time goes on i feel more weak and hurt by this. although i strongly believe he left me because he couldn't take accountability for his actions and instead of fixing the problems we had he shifted the blame onto me and that i was ""insecure ""not confident"" even tho he in no way supported me or cared for me in a way that would result in a confident or secure girlfriend. im kinda riding on the thought that he won't change for her and the same problems will likely occur in their relationship, and that he will breakup up with her because he just cant be met with things hes doing wrong, he never fixes it or apologizes. who knows. i just hate that he left me with all this emotional weight and i hate that i feel like he can just move on so fast and easy from this when i know this left a permanent scar for me. everyday im just more worried that he isn't going to regret what he did or miss me in some way. especially since he immediately got into a new relationship, while wanting to be on good terms with me. this isnt because i would take him back but it just would feel good to know hes feeling pain and remorse for all the pain and hurt hes caused me, over and over again.",breakup,1,1559.0,311.0,6.0,0.01929260450160772,-0.003215434083601286,0.08681672025723473,1.0,0.0

"met up with my ex and it felt like a date. what does this mean? tldr: dated my ex for 2 years, almost proposed, but poor communication and misaligned expectations led to a painful breakup. she moved on fast with a new guy. months later, we met up unexpectedly and ended up talking for 2.5 hours — laughing, crying, holding hands, and reminiscing. i told her i’d still take her back and start over, but she’s “seeing a good man” (said while crying). now i’m wondering — was that closure, or is there still something there? so here's my story, reddit. i genuinely want to hear outside perspectives because this one’s been stuck in my head. my ex (f23) and i (m23) were together for almost 2 years. we lived together, had long-term plans, and i was even ready to propose on a cruise — i had the ring picked out and everything. but in the months leading up to that moment, things felt off. she was applying to grad school but didn’t really include me in the process. it started to feel like i was expected to orbit around her goals, and i didn’t know where i truly fit in her future. i hesitated, and didn’t go through with the proposal — something she noticed. for context, i’m in a rotational program for work where i move around the country while getting my master’s. one option was florida, which i mentioned as a great opportunity (especially since she’s always said she hates ohio winters). i even offered to fully support her if she moved with me. but from her point of view, she thought i was set on going to florida no matter what — that i was planning to ditch her. in reality, i was trying to get a remote position to stay with her. i assumed my actions made that clear. instead of having an honest talk, she emotionally withdrew. she’s always struggled with communication, tending to suppress her feelings. eventually, things fell apart, i moved to florida, and the breakup was sudden and painful. she said she felt “peace” but also guilt. three months later, i find out she’s seeing someone new. that hurt — especially since she once told me she “wouldn’t be dating for a long time” if we broke up. but i respected it and started to move on. well… kind of. i recently returned home to visit friends and had one wish: to see her again. the universe delivered. she reached out that she had something to return and agreed to meet up. i expected a quick handoff. instead, we ended up talking for 2.5 hours — hand-holding, laughing, reminiscing, even crying. it felt like a date. i played her a song (“new way” by ana diaz — look it up). she gave me side-eyes, smiled, and said, “how’d you even find this?” i replied, “late-night soul searching.” she stuck around to see a silly painting i made at a conference, laughed, and was genuinely engaged. again — not something you'd do if you're happy and fully moved on with a new guy. when i brought him up, she just said, “he’s a good man,” while tearing up. no joy. just sadness. i told her — confidently and respectfully — “i hope it works out… but i’m selfish and i hope he fumbles because i’d love another shot.” i said i’d give up my job, car, and everything to start again with her. she was clearly taken aback, even said, “that’s not the same guy i remember.” (it’s been 3 months since the breakup.) i didn’t beg. i didn’t disrespect her or the new guy. i owned my past mistakes and told her she has the keys now — if she ever wants to come back, she just has to turn the ignition. since i didn’t have a car, she was nice enough to give me a ride to my friend’s place. just her and i. no new guy. no friends. just like old times. and it genuinely felt like a date with all the shared smiles and emotional energy. so now i’m wondering: - did it feel like a date because there’s something still there? - will this make her second-guess her new situation? or was this just nostalgia and closure wrapped in one long goodbye? - does any of this mean anything? or am i just reading into it? i’ve made peace with whatever happens. i’m building a new life in florida and slowly moving forward. but truthfully… i still love her. and i think a small part of her still loves me too, even if she won’t admit it. what do you think, reddit? what do i make of this? what’s the most likely outcome? my brain tells me it’s most likely over. but my heart… isn’t so sure.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.013301088270858524,0.009673518742442563,0.08585247883917775,5.0,0.0
"i (32f) recently separated from an individual (33m) i fell hard for, and not speaking with him for some time has brought me revelations. . . it is frustrating and complicated. i (32f) am hesitant to share because the nuances of being human, and the details and complexities of any relationship, are too intricate to squeeze into a post; however, i assume readers already take this into account. this man (33m) was someone i had never experienced; the shared experiences we had are unforgettable. in the beginning, he was sweet toward me, attentive, and deeply present. i remember how regulated my nervous system felt, how my body vibrated or had a tingling sensation when being embraced by him, how there was a mutual ‘knowing’ that we were exactly where we needed to be, and how i can still become aroused by the way he smells. his long-term dreams and goals align with mine; i want to go where he sees himself going—somewhere quiet with lush land. most of our morals and values also align. and i am not the person to raise my voice, call names, curse, or demean when having challenging conversations, and neither is he. there is so much more. and there is now. we officially separated from one another 3 or 4 weeks ago after about 4 years of being together, with about 2 years of being on and off, to figure out how to resolve issues around compatibility, viewpoints, and other challenges since getting to know one another after some years have passed that i detail below. this separation feels ‘official’ because all the other times felt incomplete, there were things to still try, and converse about. now, there are no more words; it is just a happening, and it feels as though it is becoming a solidified end. but this separation has brought up anger i have not felt before; i have been ruminating that i might have been an enabler, his emotional caretaker, from the beginning of our partnership. from day one, i consistently tried to help him realize how wonderful and capable a man he was. the more i tried for him to see himself in the mirror i held up for him, the more he seemed to move in the opposite direction, or the less he seemed to believe in himself. i suppose the mirror i held up only reflected and emphasized the negativity he believed in himself, rather than what i wanted him to see. it seemed once we got over one hurdle, he hyper focused on the next issue or negativity that i painstakingly tried to shift his perspective on e.g., from him not feeling enough because i had certain kinks he was not ready to explore, believing most if not all people had cruel, ulterior motives or just sucked in general, to thinking what was the point of anything, if we are all going to die anyways. i am indignant because i watched him slowly fall out of his passions and hobbies like photography, exploring places on his own, yoga, and camping. i watched him become disconnected, discouraged, critical, and depressed. he is not interested in therapy because he said he already ‘knew’ what the therapists would say. his issue was putting into action what he already knew he had to do. i detailed what i desired from him as a partner on multiple occasions after i noticed things began to fall away. what i thought was the bare minimum was too much and overwhelming for him. maybe because our intimacy had to be crammed onto certain days instead of spreading it throughout, or maybe it was because he could not consistently regulate his nervous system to remain in the present moment. regardless, his capacity seemed to be able to hold and think about his challenges. he seemed to always be in a process of figuring himself out, overthinking, and creating anxiety for himself out of everything, anything. i felt on occasions he could be there for me, but i was mostly there for him in the ways i knew how. because when i asked what exactly it was he needed or desired from me, he could not tell me, he said maybe it was because i had already met all his needs and desires. no matter how much we communicated or wrote to one another, it seemed to never ‘click.’ it seemed we could not put into practice what we continuously discussed, one of our most challenging patterns that we could not break. there seemed to be so much already stacked against us: our anger for our inability to make change toward betting our partnership, our inability to put our walls down and be ‘truly’ vulnerable. or maybe i was patiently waiting for him to initiate change for once, without me having to encourage or pull it out of him. it seemed he became afraid to love me after some trials and tribulations. maybe he did not love me, but loved how i loved him. maybe he could not love me because he did not know how to love himself. i recently stumbled across his reddit, where he writes openly, carefree, articulately, intellectually, expansively, and fearlessly. yet, he was afraid to meet me where i am, where i wanted to be with him in love, vulnerability, curiosity, and playfulness. he seemed to have consistently met me with his articulateness and intellectuality, but where was his openness, carefreeness, expansiveness, and fearlessness? to have the comfort of being ‘seen’ through words on a screen, but discomfort to be seen wholly in person by me. now, i am questioning what i saw and believed in him; was it there to begin with, or did i just make it all up to convince myself of what i wanted him to be? did i push him to see an idea of himself so much so that he fell into a depression? at this point, i am tired of speculating. in hindsight, it was my mistake for wearing rose-colored glasses (something he often stated, that i wore rose-colored glasses), or rather, completely ignoring the blatant signs i was given, like the several conversations where he explicitly stated he did not believe he could be the man i wanted and needed. i am frustrated for being blind and holding on for so long. maybe i am being too hard on myself. maybe it was hope. the hope he gave me, stating that he would try. maybe it was the hope of regaining what we originally felt: the intoxication of new relationship energy, the dream we believed we could build together. i am doubting everything now, what we had. was it just codependence? that seems too easy—to simply pathologize. we are human. i love a man who seems to need help, or maybe he does not need help at all, but simply, i hold too hopeful and positive a perspective on the world, and he does not, and that is okay. maybe what we had in common after the heartache was not strong enough to hold a bond. maybe i am overthinking. i do not think i can ever fully understand his perspective, pain, and challenges. i am just disheartened and upset that we could not figure out the blockages within our partnership and find a resolution. of course, he has his perspective on me. i just wish there was the capacity and ability to dig deeper with and into each other; he just seemed too afraid of himself and what we could have been. writing 'out loud,' if time is put between us, and we happen to come back together, what is it that we would need to do to stay committed? what am i missing? is it possible to find resolutions in a partnership that allows it to feel wonderful and ‘easy’ again, regardless of what has happened?",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,5.0,0.0038022813688212928,0.006844106463878327,0.08288973384030418,5.0,0.0
"dating after heartbreak for those of you who have been through relationship trauma, how did you know you were ready to start dating again? to make a long story short, my ex-fiance called off our wedding two weeks out nine months ago. it completely blindsided me. we tried to make it work again after the dust settled, and spent about 5 months in a weird limbo phase. we were basically together again but he was hesitant to label it. whatever. i was very patient and offered a lot of grace (that he definitely didn’t deserve in hindsight), even after finding a few things that made me uncomfortable. he lost his job, i found something really devastating, and he started to pull away again. i think he felt so embarrassed and guilty for what he put me through that he spiraled into self-sabotage mode. he has a lot of rejection/abandonment issues and projected a lot of his insecurities onto me. i’m not claiming to be the perfect partner, but i know i didn’t deserve having the rug pulled out from under me and then being strung along for months while he tried to figure out his shit. dude needs therapy, but whatever. this has obviously been devastating. i know his actions have more to do with his own trauma than anything else, but obviously it’s hard not to take it all personally. i’ve done a lot of work in therapy, but it’s still really fucking hard navigating this kind of grief. i can’t even fathom being ready to date again. the thought of getting back on the apps when you thought you’d never have to is depressing. at the same time, i’m in my late 30s and feel an overwhelming sense of missing out on so many major milestones. i’m mourning a future i never doubted. it’s a wild place to be mentally. i don’t need anyone to tell me i’m not ready; i’m well aware. i’m just curious to hear about others’ experiences who have been in a similar situation. was there a turning point for you?",breakup,1,1896.0,364.0,2.0,0.005494505494505495,0.0027472527472527475,0.07417582417582418,2.0,0.0

"no closure? here’s mine… we had a situationship that lasted about a month. it started on a hookup site but instantly became something more emotional. we clicked. deep conversations, similar interests, constant texting, hours on the phone. it wasn’t love, but there was definitely a connection, and he said he felt it too. i was clear from the beginning. no expectations, just respect (i know im in a point in my life where a relationship is a responsibility i can’t give myself 100% to, it would not be fair to either party). we even planned for me to travel to see him for a few days. we’d hook up and hang out. casual, but emotionally honest. we told each other from the start we would be transparent, and that’s exactly what i did. i just ignored the fact that he was never transparent back. now i know, a month is not enough time to truly form a connection with someone. the problem is that he never respected the connection that was forming. right as we were about to finalize the trip, he asked me, “if you came, would you end up hurt?” i told him the same thing i always had, no expectations, just don’t disrespect me. he said okay and we moved on. as an afterthought to a question he had i said, “the only reason i’d cancel the trip is if you weren’t 100% sure about meeting me or if you found someone else.” i said this because it’s completely true. why would i want to go out of my way to travel to someone who doesn’t even want to see me? and why would i interfere with a real connection of his end if i knew i couldn’t offer the same? it was completely hypothetical, and it was mainly a point for him to understand that i cared about what he thought. that’s when he turned weirdly defensive. he said, “you told me i could see other people, so i don’t get why you’re saying that.” i tried to explain he was free to explore anything with anyone, after all i would only have the right to ask for monogamy if i knew there was a possibility of a relationship. he didn’t want to hear it. he spiraled, said he wasn’t in a good place mentally, and bailed. i was understanding, even kind. i gave him options. told him we can completely go no contact or try things out as only friends because i did value our conversations. he said he “didn’t know” what he wanted. so i left, respectfully, but i was furious. he ghosted, didn’t block me, just left it open. the whole conversation just made me realize he never valued my transparency. he tolerated it. and never gave any back. so i wrote this. i haven’t sent it. maybe i never will. but i need this off my chest…. “here’s the truth, brutal and unfiltered. you weren’t some emotionally deep guy navigating hard feelings. you were a half-formed boy playing with something you weren’t built to hold. you initiated all of this. you pursued me. you said you felt the connection. you made plans. you pulled me in with attention and intimacy, and then flinched the second it required the tiniest shred of maturity. you disappeared behind a weak excuse and hoped i'd make the exit easy for you. you didn't even have the respect to finish what you started. you ghosted under the guise of being 'considerate.' no. you were just spineless. you weren’t confused. you weren’t overwhelmed. you were never serious about anything other than yourself. you liked the way i made you feel, you just never intended to give anything back. you used me like an emotional mirror. and i see that now. i was honest. i was clear. i gave you more grace than you earned. and what did you give me? silence. avoidance. an unfinished conversation you didn’t even have the guts to close. you were never deep, you were just emotionally lazy. you don’t get to show up half-assed and leave with dignity. you don’t get to read my words and pretend they don’t apply to you. and you sure as hell don’t get to come back later when your loneliness finally catches up. this isn’t heartbreak. this is clarity. and this is me cutting you off completely, mentally and emotionally. you're done. you are nothing more than a lesson i won’t need twice.” i mean every word. i didn’t write this hoping one day he’d see this and change. i wrote it so i could walk away knowing i said what needed to be said to someone. even if this catches the eye of one person, i know at least it’s out there. let this be a reminder to all you beautiful people out there, you can end something with dignity, even if the other person doesn’t. you’re allowed to be angry. you’re allowed to say it out loud :)",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.011494252873563218,0.0011494252873563218,0.08160919540229886,5.0,0.0

"i find myself and a new love among petals and goodbyes each breakup with him felt like a small death—not just of the bond we once shared, but of the idealized version of him i kept clinging to, even when there was nothing real left to hold on to. every time he left, he did it with cruelty: indifferent, calculated, as if finding satisfaction in my pain gave him back the control he feared losing. he spoke words that hurt more than silence, leaving behind the echo of a broken promise and a shattered heart. he played with my nostalgia like someone picking at an open wound. he knew how to return just when i felt most vulnerable, with empty gestures that looked like affection but were nothing more than an extension of his selfishness. sometimes, i even found myself wishing he would come back—just to have something to rebuild. but without realizing it, each goodbye gave me something: more self-love, more strength, more clarity. every breakup loosened his grip on me a little more, as if his image was being swept away by the winds of time. and in the middle of all that pain, there was him… my friend, the florist. we never planned anything. he was just as broken as i was, carrying his own story full of scars. but we talked, really talked. in his words, i found comfort. in his silences, peace. at first, it was just companionship—a mutual refuge. but something began to blossom, slowly and quietly, without either of us daring to name it. we were used to endings, so beginnings scared us. but every gesture, every afternoon spent among flowers and honest conversations, showed us that maybe we deserved something new—something gentle. we’re not rushing. we don’t need to. all we know is that with each passing day, the memories and emotional attachments to our exes fade more and more—like spring mist dissolving between flower petals as the sun begins to rise. and where once there were open wounds, new roots are beginning to grow… something different, something real. and this time, it doesn’t hurt. this time, it blooms.",breakup,1,2034.0,366.0,7.5,0.02185792349726776,-0.00546448087431694,0.06284153005464481,0.0,0.0
"my first serious relationship ended abruptly because they weren’t ready for a relationship my gf (25 nb) and i (26 f)were long distance for about six months i flew out to meet them. the first two days were wonderful. we hit it off just like we did online. i had lunch with their dad. we shopped together and i cooked for them and their roommate. i helped them clean their depression room. the second evening, i initiated sex (which is something we’d talked about leading up to the visit). they said they weren’t ready or in the right headspace, then they began having an anxiety attack. i told them i would never make them do something they were uncomfortable with. they explained that past partners had pressured them. i cried because i was embarrassed and because i felt like i hurt them. i slept on the couch. the next morning they didn’t sit next to me like they had before. we spent all day watching movies and it felt normal. that evening i asked if we were okay. they said they don’t know what they want. i asked if this was about sex or about our relationship. they said the latter. i asked if they were breaking up. they said they aren’t able to be in a relationship. i asked when they planned on telling me. they said they’d been trying to think of how to tell me all day. i left and went to a hotel for my last night before flying home. this is my first heart break. i dated before, but never someone i liked this much. as someone on the spectrum, connections are hard for me. they understood me like no one else. i could tell them anything. we could just sit on a call in silence and be okay. i feel like i have whiplash. before my trip i told all my friends and family about how excited i was. i had to come home with bad news. i feel humiliated, undesirable, and lonely. we have a lot of mutual friends online (we game together), and i don’t feel comfortable in those spaces anymore. they say they still want to be friends, but it’s not the same. i send them things that will make them laugh, and they reply. but that’s it. i used to talk to them every day. and now it’s over. i’m not angry at them anymore. i was at first for how abrupt it was, but they can’t help their trauma or their feelings. now i’m just empty. i cried for almost two days straight after the trip. i thought i was feeling better, but i ended up having a breakdown that could only be stopped with weed. then another one a few days later that only stopped when i chugged alcohol. i had a panic attack at work this week. it’s been exactly two weeks, and i’m so lonely it hurts. i go to work, go out with friends, see family, and then i come back home and start crying again. i miss them so much. i miss that friend group. i just want to go back to normal.",breakup,1,2739.0,544.0,3.0,0.0055147058823529415,-0.009191176470588236,0.1213235294117647,0.0,0.0

"my girlfriend (21f) broke up with me (24m) after she failed to pass her 2nd year of university. i've been seeing my current girlfriend for a good 6-7 months. the last couple of months i've received love and acceptance in a way that i've never experienced before. i was treated poorly in the past and this finally felt like the relationship i've always wanted. we attend the same university, and for the last 2 semesters i've been cruising with high grades with little to no effort. my girlfriend on the other hand struggled a lot, her grades were in free fall and with every semester results she shuts down and goes into some sort of psychosis (idk if i can call it that but deep detachment from life and herself). the end of year results came around and i did so well that i got sent on a university trip for top students, while she was retaking exams. all of this being said, i couldn't care less about all of this, i'm stating this only for context. every single exam period i've tried reassuring her, my only focus was her passing semester i would put my revision on hold just to be able to help her study. i've done everything in my power so she could pass the year, literally everything i can do just to help her feel okay. i've even reassured her that i've failed 4 years in a row and i'm okay and still pushing. no matter what i said or how much i reassured this was life or death for her. 5 days before the results of her exams we've run into issues in our relationship, she was being overly aggressive cold and on edge. all of a sudden she felt like it was too much, that the academic failure she was living was the main issue. she broke it off with me then and there saying that she wants to rebuild her social circle because she's been led astray and that caused her academic failure. my mind couldn't compute this and i decided to accept it. after three days i was still in shock and denial, so i called her and we got ""back together"" but she had one foot out the door and i knew it but still decided to stay because i've never been so sure that someone loved me ever. fast forward to yesterday where it got confirmed that she's repeating the year, she just sends me a texts ""our break will still keep going and i think there's no going back"". i'm genuinely confused. this is someone who i know 100% is deeply in love with me, but when this thing came around it's like i was this barrier or burden i don't know what to even call it. i'm not minimizing her issues, this is a big deal for her and i want to be there for her. i just don't get how leaving me solves anything. i'm being so genuine when i say i tried everything to help her. i can't bring up my concerns or emotional state because it's selfish as she's going through a lot. i still want to be with her, i've learnt when to let go of relationships. i was single for a long time before her, but this just feels so random and weird all at the same time. what do i do?",breakup,1,2938.0,564.0,7.0,0.012411347517730497,0.008865248226950355,0.07624113475177305,1.0,0.0
"she broke up with me in march , still having a hard time.. an i wrong for feeling this way? hey everyone, i’ve been quietly following r/breakups for a while, and now i need to get this off my chest. i’ve been reflecting on texts from march to april with my ex, and it’s been a gut punch of emotions that’s left me questioning my actions. i’m here to sort it out and hear your perspective did i push things too far, or was this breakup just inevitable? it started in early march when she lost sleep worrying about me being sick, a sign we still had some connection. by march, she sent a quick “i love you,” but it felt more like a habit than deep feeling, maybe because she was already worn out. mid march got tense when she said she missed me, but i couldn’t find the words to reply, and that silence hurt us both. then, she needed time to process a video i sent that clearly broke her heart, and i didn’t know how to fix it. she tried a playful “who dis?” with a new number, hoping to lighten things, but it just showed how distant we’d become. march was a mess when she lashed out saying she’d found someone else to make her happy, though later she admitted it was a lie to push me away because she was exhausted and couldn’t keep me happy. she demanded space, warning we were done if i didn’t give it i felt lost but backed off. late march, she tried to hold on; she felt for my cousin’s loss, and suggested family photos, but a missing package had her doubting me. april just got heavier. she was furious i blocked her after she sent desperate, humiliating texts, and i felt cornered by her intensity. she accused me of messing with her mind, mentioning a voicemail i ignored, and the gap between us widened. april was rough when she tried to calm things, saying she didn’t want fights or threats, but admitted i’d pushed her to a breaking point where she almost gave up. she was mad i sent stuff through strangers instead of facing her, and i didn’t know how to respond. she wouldn’t let it go, and by april mentioned an appointment maybe therapy to deal with trust issues and threats, leaving me feeling like i’d failed her. the end hit hard in late april. she told me she’d ignored her therapist’s advice because she loved me so much, just wanting to hold me and see if i was real she even said she didn’t care if i was with someone else, just don’t tell her, and suggested i get tested. she said “i love you goodnight,” warned me she looked rough from months of being sick, and asked for honesty, giving it one last shot. she asked if i worked, clinging to normalcy. then she broke down and admitted she’d slept with someone else after we split, apologized, and said i could block her if i wanted i was stunned. i lost it, calling her crazy and telling her never to contact me again, while she just said she was disappointed, and that was it. then came may, and i did something i can’t undo. i crossed a line i was furious, humiliated, and heartbroken, pushed past what i could handle, and i lashed out. i wasn’t thinking about right or wrong; i just wanted her to feel a piece of the pain she’d dumped on me. i wanted her exposed, embarrassed, and powerless, because that’s how she left me tossed out, blamed, silenced, and erased. she walked away spotless, twisting the story her way while i was left in the rubble, dazed and hurt. but now i see it: that moment wasn’t strength it was pain i couldn’t carry, turning me into someone i don’t recognize. i’m not proud of it, but i won’t hate myself for being human and hurting. i don’t owe her forgiveness, contact, or peace, but i owe myself a fresh start. i owe myself the power to stop letting her drag me back into her drama. i don’t need to fight for the truth anymore i just need to live it. what happened was raw, but it wasn’t pointless; it came from betrayal, abandonment, and manipulation, and i reacted. that side of me doesn’t need to be buried it needs to be understood. now that i’ve faced it, i know i won’t lose myself like that again. she doesn’t get to define me by my worst day i do. and this is where i leave her behind, not for revenge or closure, but for my own peace. looking back, it started with love but crashed with that video in mid march. i struggled to hold on, but the trust was gone, and her health struggles by april made it worse. her confession about the other person and my may outburst felt like the final blows did i push too hard, or was it already over? it’s been over two months now, and i’m still wrestling with it. was i wrong to shut her out, react the way i did, or let it end like that? i’d really appreciate any advice or stories from you all thanks for being here.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.016094420600858368,0.00536480686695279,0.09978540772532189,5.0,0.0
"is it normal to move on in 9 months i broke up with my boyfriend of nearly 4 years in september because i didn’t feel ready to get married (and he wanted to) and as a result started to doubt parts of the relationship. we’re from different cultures and that was one thing i started to have an issue with. the problem is is that i loved him so so so much like he is genuinely the love of my life but i knew i wasn’t making him happy because i wasn’t giving my 100% and i knew i wasn’t in the right head space. he is genuinely everything and is so perfect and is the best person to be in a relationship with and we got on so well and he loved me so much. fast forwarded to now, it had been nearly 9 months and ive changed a lot. i’m ready to get married and i know that he’s the one i want to be with, i really haven’t moved on at all. i hand-wrote him a 25 page letter explaining how i felt and delivered it to his house. the letter took hours and hours as you can imagine. i genuinely love him with my whole heart and i feel that i have made a massive mistake and i want to be married to him. he responded and said that he doesn’t have feelings fr me anymore, and he doesn’t think he ever could again. he said even if he wanted to his family wouldn’t allow him to. he said he’s changed and that this is no longer what he wants because he felt like he wasn’t treated right. i am so so devastated and depressed. i’ve genuinely felt the lowest i’ve ever felt in my life, more than when it first ended. the reason is because i can see so clearly how happy we could be together and how much ive changed for him but he doesn’t want that anymore. it’s so hard when you love someone this much and they don’t want anything to do with you. also, because i was the problem before, he had so many things probably to help him to move on but because he was genuinely perfect i can’t think of a single negative thing to help me move on. all i can think is how sad i am and how low i feel. i genuinely have no energy to do anything and all i think about or want to talk about is this. i just don’t know what to do and i really don’t feel like im going to get better. how can i get better knowing that i ruined my chance at happiness? knowing that i let the love of my life go? knowing that everything was my fault? it makes me sad also because i don’t understand how he can be so moved on in less than 9 months when our connection and love was so deep? is that normal? please, i need advice, how can i move on as he has?",breakup,1,2503.0,532.0,3.0,0.005639097744360902,0.016917293233082706,0.10150375939849623,5.0,0.0
"got back with ex, found out he has been dating a new girl the whole time i was in a serious relationship with my boyfriend for 7 years, it was amazing at the beginning he was so romantic and it really felt like a fairytale even though we were very different people. over time he started to become very complacent, and could be very cold and cruel at times, was shady with his phone and instagram, would never commit to marriage and was generally very argumentative, so my love for him faded because of this. after a huge argument we had because he cancelled last minute on our anniversary dinner (due to a night of heavy drinking the day before) i broke up with him. this was in december. he wanted to get back together almost immediately and would spam me with calls and texts, letters and flowers, but i just felt like there was no way we could make it work. eventually, he got through to me and convinced me that he had been going to therapy, working on himself, and that he had truly changed and would be better boyfriend and wanted marriage etc. so we started talking and eventually going out on dates and even sleeping together again as the love and spark came back - but every time i asked when we should tell people we were back together, for some reason he then hesitated and made up excuses. we had started talking pretty much every day and seeing each other weekly in february. now it is june, and i was starting to feel so happy and excited for a new and improved relationship with someone who i cared so so much for… and then i hear he has been dating someone for months, introducing her to his friends, had each other’s location on their phones, and as of yesterday was still dating her, according to my friend who is close to the new girl’s best friend, (a girl that is dating my ex’s best friend.) i feel so sick and betrayed, and so exceptionally stupid. i knew what he was like but i still went along with it. i really wanted to believe it could be like it was in the beginning, i feel so devastated. i don’t want to put the person who told me this in an awkward position at all so i just decided to block him on everything without a word. when he knew i was meeting this girl asked me to please not mention him at all. we were chatting normally and sending cute messages this morning, and now he is blocked on everything and using his dad’s phone to call me constantly. i don’t know what to do, he is incredibly good at convincing me that he has done nothing wrong - very very very good, he has done it many times. and clearly an exceptional liar as he has been seeing me, her, and god knows who else since we broke up. now i think he may have been lying about therapy too. do i respond to him or talk to him about it? am i being unreasonable to just totally ghost him because of this? he is still calling me on his dad’s phone as i type this, over and over again. could use opinions, as i am spiralling.",breakup,1,2923.0,566.0,5.0,0.0088339222614841,0.0088339222614841,0.07773851590106007,2.0,0.0
"genuinely need some help :( i am going crazy it’s been almost 2 months since we broke up. i was the one who ended it — not because i stopped loving her, but because i felt emotionally drained and unseen. my needs weren’t being met. she was inconsistent, avoided emotional closeness, and i constantly felt uncertain about where we stood. i used to be patient, calm, and grounded — but over time i became reactive and emotionally anxious because i felt like i was the only one fighting for the relationship. we were long-distance, but i showed up — planned trips, made time, put effort into thoughtful gestures. we shared intimacy that felt deep to me — emotionally and physically. but behind the surface, there was always a layer of emotional distance from her that i could never quite get through. early in the relationship, i found out she was still talking to her ex — something she never disclosed, and something i stumbled on by accident. i even discovered she still had intimate videos from that past relationship, which broke my heart. that, combined with her texting another guy and trying to go on a date after we became exclusive, really shattered the trust. she claimed she didn’t follow through, but it didn’t matter — i felt betrayed. i forgave her, but i couldn’t forget. after i forgave her and she asked me to ask her to be my girlfriend, she looked genuinely happy. for a while, it felt like she really loved me deeply. she took me to meet all her close friends, took me to meet her family, stayed with them many times, went out to dinner with them etc. when i was with her at her place i used to check her ipad because of trust issues (i know i was wrong her) and she found out and that broke her trust as well we communicated and she forgave me. the main issue was every month, she would emotionally distance herself for 7–10 days — completely shut down, become cold, and unreachable. it wrecked me every time. i’d express how it made me feel, how it reopened my fears, and begged her not to pull away again.. but that cycle repeated — and asking her every time not to disappear drained her too. we were both emotionally exhausted, trying to keep something alive while we bled out. after the breakup, i blocked her from everything except tiktok. the next day, she texted me there saying she “wanted to talk,” but didn’t open up when i called (same old avoidance and pulling away). then she went back to talking to old flings — within one week. the next week i travelled to her city for work and she found out i was there through mutuals and she texted me “i miss you being here, cant change it, just saying and asked me if we could grab coffee but i didn’t agree to it because it took her one week to reach out to old fling. a month later, she was back on dating apps and even followed the same guy who had caused the original trust issues when we were exclusive. that was the final punch but it made me laugh because that guy didn’t follow her back and that she is trying to fill the void with anyone and everyone. the last few days have been brutal. i thought i was doing okay, but i stumbled on our backed-up photos in google — videos of her calling me “baby,” of her smiling, laughing in bed, cooking together, going on hikes. everything came flooding back. and while i’m crying in bed, she’s recently started posting tiktok videos and she looks happy, looking like nothing happened. we had real moments. i helped her process trauma. i held space for her. i was patient, loving, and gave her all of me. but it felt like she couldn’t give me the same in return — or wouldn’t. and now, she’s moved on like i was just a pitstop in her story. i’m not even angry at her anymore — i just feel disposable. has anyone else experienced this kind of delayed grief, even when you were the one who ended it? i still love her, but i know i couldn’t stay in a relationship where i didn’t feel emotionally safe. i’m trying to move on, but the weight of it all still sits heavy on my chest.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,5.0,0.006648936170212766,0.010638297872340425,0.10106382978723404,1.0,0.0

"it's been two years and i'm still picking up the pieces, me and my ex girlfriend started dating three years ago, it was just kinda like, a depressing day for me honestly, i was very withdrawn mentally i just got out of a horribly abusive relationship with my ex a few months prior, (sexually cohersive pathetic looser) it was algebra class back in highschool, i had noticed her before... the cute emo kid in the back of class, always made me blush from the start, one day she just... sat next to me, i didn't really think much of it but oh boy was i blushing internally, she said i just looked ""interesting"" i did notice however that she was shaking really badly, apparently later she said she was about to have a panic attack, i don't remember exactly why, but months later she never really came to school, one day tho she tried to approach me chickened out came back around chickened out again and i guess we started talking from there? i fell in love quickly and so did she honestly i don't remember somewhere along the line *i* had a panic attack and suddenly we understood eachother so well she felt like she finnaly wasn't alone and so did i, but the thing was this was the first time i ever felt real love, every other time i was being manipulated by some sleez bag, i actually felt love, real love, and it changed everything, it was such a contrast to my shitty life i could tell more stories but honestly i guess i couldn't but i loved her so so so deeply, but the truth is? she never really loved me, i don't think she did... she just wanted an insurance policy, she wanted intimacy in person because she only has an online relationship for years, she felt like she was obligated to save the world, she pittied me, she wanted me to feel special and loved and... well she did. she would always talk about how she wanted someone to just love her for who she was... but i did.... someone who wouldn't leave.... i didn't... but i guess at some point she realized she was better off without me, she even said that out loud, she realized she deserved people who didn't stress her out (i couldn't help my life was shambles and i was fighting desperately to glue it together) she deserved someone attractive someone she *wanted* and she didn't owe anyone commitment, i guess i'm happy for her but in reality? i'm not. i wish she never knew. i always said i wanted her to finnaly develop a sense of self worth i even said things that only hurt her relationship with me sacrificing myself for what i thought would be her better future that if i did that it would show i was worth keeping. it didn't. the opposite infact. all it did was show her she deserved better... if i had known i would never meet someone like her again if i had known i'd never deserve a second chance. that i'd be alone and heartbroken for years. i would have chosen to be selfish. it would have been the only way. am i fucked up? kinda yeah. but someone like me will never deserve someone like her. the only way i can ever have anyone is if they believe the aren't good enough for anyone else. if they believe they have to settle for me. the more this happens the more and more i just wanna be selfish. i'll never have my slice of life if i'm not. this world wasn't built for people like me. and i care less anyways. the make people that discard me like trash? that i have to go ""i understand"" to that i have to be afraid of live in fear of constantly excusing everything about myself. maybe i don't care. maybe i'm tired of caring? will i...? yeah- it's just in my nature. at my very core it's not gonna go away, but i'm still changing a quiet fury is building up inside me, a quiet bitterness... a quiet rebellion, a silent protest to the world. if i'm trash, if i'm subhuman so are you. and i'll treat you like it.",breakup,1,3791.0,687.0,4.0,0.005563282336578581,0.01808066759388039,0.09874826147426982,5.0,0.0
"really struggling with losing someone who meant the world to me my (25m) girlfriend (23f) ended things with me abruptly on a wednesday night right as i got home from work. it was a shock and both of us were crying. i didn’t understand at all as we had a great couple of nights prior. this was a month ago. we went no contact and i did well for about an eight days. then i couldn’t handle being away from her anymore. it was like how people say their grandparents act different when they’re away from their partner. i just felt so alone and missed the laughter and care we had for one another. i know breaking no-contact was a mistake. i’ve struggled with controlling my sadness and often times feel this need to hold on tight. i ask and ask for conversation so we can talk things through. it wasn’t pretty. i was full of tears. she made it very clear i have things i need to see to. i have really bad addictions to my phone and video games. i’ve since removed video games from my life and have spent an average of three hours a day on my phone versus an average of eight! i’ve also gone to therapy and am seeing a life coach to help me find a career more in line with what matters to me. i’ve supplemented that by volunteering at my church’s soup kitchen which has been really calming. i’ve committed to making these changes for myself because i know i needed to change. however, i also wanted to show this effort to her. fast forward a week or so, she’s in town. she lets me know and asks to meet up. instantly i am all ears. it went so well. i had an absolute blast and i really get that our spark was still there. i then maybe made the mistake of asking her if we could squeeze in more time sunday. “sure” but she was quick to remind me that she still needs space after her visit. i was so excited to tell her about my new habits and routine, but this time she seemed cold and more distant. i know i was always rough around the edges, but i always gave her my all. as we said goodbye, it felt final, and i said that… she said maybe she’ll reach out in a month or so when my emotions have settled… i was gutted because it felt done… i wanted to change because i know i could be better, and i wanted to show her that i was doing this because she is important to me. i just feel alone and broken.",breakup,1,2296.0,466.0,5.0,0.01072961373390558,0.004291845493562232,0.12660944206008584,0.0,0.0

"it starts hurting more after a month, we still have contact. i feel much worse after my family found out about the breakup. hi, i guess it's gonna be vent. so a month ago my ex broke up with me, random monday, i didn't feel like we had any problems, i thought we were both fully interested in continuing the relationship. our breakup was pretty calm and mature. i thought we were ending contact completely, but he convinced me that we could still be best friends. i honestly liked this option. the first two days were awful, but after that i started to feel okay. i have a feeling it was only because i convinced myself we would get back together. there are moments when our conversations seem more like flirting or something more, which was also quite confusing and still is, especially since we have both said many times that a friends with benefits is not for us. now, after a month, it's starting to dawn on me that maybe we won't get back together this time. i feel like lying down and crying again. today he texted me that his friends were asking so much about me, that he had to tell them that we broke up, and that they were quite shocked and curious why. this also definitely broke me because, if he told them, it is already a certain decision. but i was also surprised that it was only now that he told them, considering that they have contact with each other every day. and honestly i feel like his family still doesn't know, so his mom probably thinks i'm going camping with them in august. now i'm at a family reunion for a week where everyone knows we were together, most of them have met him so the news of our breakup spread quickly. literally as a greeting i got ""there are still plenty of fish in the sea"" instead of hey. and now i have the impression that this is the main topic towards me. so now i'm getting advice from everyone that i need to find someone new, or better yet, start sleeping with as many men as possible and choose the best one. that if i find someone and we get married it will probably end in divorce, but then i will find that true love. and of course there was talk that since my ex is man in his mid 20's he must have cheated on me. i know he didn't do that, i know him and over the years we've never had any issues with infidelity, and it definitely wasn't the reason we broke up. which doesn't change the fact that it somehow hits me every time, and it makes me start to overthink, and it makes me irritated. i just wish someone would just say that it will be okay whether we get back together or not, instead of treating this as the perfect time to push me into clubs or tell me about their theories.",breakup,1,2646.0,507.0,7.5,0.02564102564102564,0.0,0.10453648915187377,0.0,0.0
"i cant stop thinking about my girl. i broke her heart, and now she broke mine. im sorry for all the grammar errors i just feel so raw and heartbroken and empty and despairful ane grieving. her crying is etched into my memories, and i feel so awful for provoking it. i jsut broke up with her. the feelings are so raw and emotional. she was codependent snd that was the crux of the issue. i just wrote a long thing here and i lost it. it froze on me. i wrote her a final message hours ago telling her how much i loved her and how much this affected me because she thought it didnt affect me. no snuggles, no kisses, no vacation like we were supposed to have. just emptiness. and i see her location. and like it being there. i like seeing her contact in my phone even though it hurts. i just feel so numb after sobbing. her last texts were begging me to give her another chance but i didnt budge. and i sent her this. it hurts to even see your face in my contacts, and i’ve been sobbing. i just want you to know that i did care about doing tbis and feel like it was right for both of us but really want the absolute best for you in life. this was far from easy and i feel so much hurt inside. i feel horrible about this but hope you can find someone who really makes you happy, as sad as that makes me to say. love zach i feel so sad and so numb, like a hole in my chest thats filled with good memories. we had a great relationship besides the recent arguments. she didn’t want me to see my family, wanted ne back at certain times, wanted me to run everything by her in terms of future hangouts with frienfs or family and if i came home slightly late shed be secretly stewing. so i couldn’t love her how she wanted me too. and she couldn’t love me how i wanted her to - with breaks of independence. it was toxic but also loving and fantastic at times. im starting my new job at a great company in two days but it’s overshadowed by this. i just feel awful, and don’t know what to do. almost feel willing to text hef again, and want her to text me so bad for some reason, just for her to show me she still loves me like i love her. i dont know how to go on, because ai knew the relationship wasn’t gonna work, but don’t want it to end, but it already has. her removimg my name from the ig bio stung like hell, as it seemed like she went from sobbing and begging for me to stamping me out. but she didnt block me, and i didnt block her, and maybe thaat connection — and my location that she can see, and her location that i can see — is what we need to get through this. she told me she would change to what i wanted but i felt wrong about that. zhe wouldnt be happy and eventually it would change. ahe was desperate but now i feel like her.",breakup,1,2735.0,557.0,7.5,0.01436265709156194,0.010771992818671455,0.10951526032315978,0.0,0.0

"my boyfriend 20m and i 21f he becomes emotionally distant when stressed — is this normal or are we slowly falling apart? my boyfriend 20m and i 21f it's been 1.5 years together ,and we were like the happiest couples . recently, he’s been under a lot of stress due to college admissions, and i completely understand that. but when he gets stressed, it feels like i disappear from his life... whenever i try to talk about our relationship or how i’m feeling, he tells me he's “trying,” but i don’t really see any changes in his actions. a few days ago, even after repeatedly telling him i was hungry, he forgot entirely. we’ve had a few small arguments recently, which we’ve talked through, but overall, i feel like we’re drifting. one thing that really got to me: he used to say “good night” every night, without fail. it was a small gesture that made me feel remembered. now, he doesn’t, and that change triggered my panic attacks again. i told him how i felt last night — he apologized a lot and stayed up texting me till 3 am. but tonight, it’s the same — no message, no check-in. i know sleep isn’t fully in our control, and i don't want to nitpick, but even when i’ve cried next to him, he doesn’t wake up or comfort me. he’s also been skipping meals and feeling physically drained. when i try to explain how his emotional absence is affecting me, he just tells me how hard things are for him, and i end up feeling guilty for even bringing it up. i’m not asking for fancy dates or big gestures — i just want the emotional bare minimum. but lately, even that feels like too much to ask. i’ve noticed he only really responds if i flirt heavily or say something extreme, which makes me feel awful. i don’t think he’s cheating — he’s not that kind of person — but i honestly don’t know if he still loves me. he doesn’t laugh at my jokes anymore, even the silly ones he used to love. his expressions have changed. it’s like he doesn’t hate me, but it feels like he doesn’t see me either. i’ve never expected much, and i’ve given my all to this relationship. but now, i’m left feeling like i’m annoying or burdensome for even asking for attention. i’m genuinely confused — is this just a rough patch, or am i holding on to something that’s already ending? would really appreciate some outside perspective.",breakup,1,2303.0,446.0,3.0,0.006726457399103139,0.002242152466367713,0.11434977578475336,2.0,0.0
"she left, i’m trying to understand what really happened and whether i should cut all contact i’m really struggling to make sense of a breakup and i’d really appreciate some outside perspectives. i (32m) was in a relationship with a colleague (35f) for more than a year. it was intense and meaningful — we connected deeply, and early on she talked about me moving in with her and her children. i said i prefered to take things slowly about that. sometimes she pressured me a lot and didn’t let me space. she wanted to spend every minutes together even when we’re seeing each other already at work. our relationship wasn’t known at work, only by our friends and family, because the director was against this kind of things. i admit i became distant at times. i didn’t step up when i should have. but i was always careful, making her surprises and to her children too, driving 30mn to her place at 3am when she called me just because she didn’t feel good etc i spent time with her and her children, taking them to a resort park, to the boy’s birthday… only 3 days before we broke up she was still sending me cute messages and hugging me all the time. recently, she started growing close to the director who just became single. i had suspicions something was happening — there were signs — but she never admitted to anything directly. she just told me that she indeed tried something with him because he gave her feelings that the door was open and that she was feeling lonely and i made her wait for too long to committing, move with her and her children (6 and 12 yo) and everything. that she cried too much because of me and don’t believe in us. but she’s still sending mixed signals: • she didn’t take back all of her stuff or her keys. • her whatsapp photo is still one she took for me in my bed. • she recently messaged me: “it felt good to talk to you.” i asked her to tell me clearly if i didn’t miss her and if she really don’t want to live with me anymore. but she said « you know i can’t say that ». she says she has still feelings for me but don’t want to keep fighting for the relationship and she won’t come back. i told her i still loved her. i said if she ever wanted to try again, i’d be there. but she hasn’t even opened that last message — it’s been over a day. i’m spiraling. i imagine them together all the time. and my instinct scream that it’s already the case. i can’t sleep. i can’t eat. i feel lost. i don’t know if i have enough strength to go to work and being with them two. we have several meetings per week and i’m pretty sure that, even if they see each other, she didn’t tell him about me. so here i am wondering: • should i go no contact even after telling her the door was open? • was she ever fully honest with me? or was the breakup already planned so she could be free to explore something with someone else? • am i just prolonging my pain by clinging to the past? i don’t know what to do. i feel devastated. i surprised myself watching by the 6th floor window for a jump. i know i wasn’t perfect, i know i should have been more here for her sometimes. but does that justify this? it’s like i was nothing to her even if she always told me she loved me, that she would give me a child and spend the rest of her life with me. thanks for reading. any advice or perspective is welcomes .",breakup,1,3317.0,658.0,7.0,0.010638297872340425,0.00303951367781155,0.10638297872340426,5.0,0.0
"what i know now (still hurts though) i didn’t realize we were coming at this relationship from completely different places. i was trying to build something real, something that could survive arguments, miscommunication, hard days. i thought if i was patient, if i explained myself, if i showed her i cared, it would matter. but she wasn’t operating from that same mindset. i was trying to fix. she was trying to maintain control. that mismatch alone made everything harder than it had to be. i didn’t fully understand how our emotional wiring clashed. i tend to lean in when things get tense. i try to talk it through, understand, make sense of it. she pulled away, lashed out, or blamed. the more i tried to hold things together, the more it seemed to push her further away. i didn’t realize i was caught in a loop. me chasing connection. her pulling back or flipping the story. and neither of us could break it. i also kept assuming her messages meant the same things mine did. when she was upset, i took it as an opening. a chance to clear things up. but most of the time, she wasn’t trying to work through anything. she just needed someone to take the hit. i kept walking into those moments thinking we were going to figure things out, but i was just giving her more chances to unload and then blame me for the fallout.i carried too much of the emotional weight. i took responsibility for things i didn’t even fully understand, because i thought it would help. i tried to own my part, even when it wasn’t all mine to carry. and she let me. she dumped her pain on me and called it honesty. i was trying to meet in the middle. she was handing me all the blame and stepping back.what i didn’t see was how much of this was about control. not love. not connection. she needed to feel like she was the one calling the shots, and i needed to feel like we were both trying. that difference. that fundamental split. is what kept us stuck. i wasn’t wrong for caring. but i was wrong for thinking that effort alone was enough to fix something this unbalanced.",breakup,1,2052.0,390.0,3.0,0.007692307692307693,-0.002564102564102564,0.11025641025641025,0.0,0.0

support system i just ended a 7 year relationship. i just went on a trip with some friends and it was the best 5 days of my life but it came with hard decisions i knew i had to make when i returned. i met a new friend that was the cousin of the good friend who invited me on the trip. we instantly clicked and had a lot in common and turned out shared trauma. they shared how they recently just got out of a 6 year relationship 6 months ago. we spent the night and next night staying up just talking about our trials and tribulations of our common issues we had in our relationship. they gave me their opinions and of course was hoping that their opinions wouldn't lead me to the solution of ending my 7 year relationship. but when a complete stranger we all met on our trip was giving us all advice and gave me advice that just hit right on the nail and hit home so hard. i just knew what i had to do. all of my friends were so supportive and it was the first time that i ever got drunk to drown all my emotions that were now surfacing that i kept locked away for so long. but that one person held me down the most in those 5 days. and now that were returned from the trip and i am going through this very emotional time. i am having the hardest time coping with everything because the one person that kept me grounded so much isn't here. i know they have their own life to live and are enjoying the freedom that they have been living ever since then but it just fucking sucks that i don't hear from them as often as i thought i would. i am happy that i get what they are able to give when they can but fuck i wish i could lean on them more. i guess what i am asking is. how do you move forward.,breakup,1,1696.0,339.0,0.0,0.0,0.008849557522123894,0.12094395280235988,0.0,0.0

"my ex reached out. but avoidants don't really change. i was in a relationship with an avoidant long before i understood attachment theory and what that meant, but i recognized the pattern before the end of the relationship. surviving on crumbs, trying to convince myself i didn't need my affections or attention reciprocated, going through the push-pull cycle, basically everything that comes along with being in a relationship with an avoidant. most everything said here is true. we'd had the same conversation a half dozen times about my emotional needs and how the relationship was becoming unhealthy. the post not long ago that likened the breadcrumbing stage to addiction was remarkably accurate. i happened to make a friend that is still recovering from her previous relationship, also with a textbook avoidant. i started talking with her about our experiences, which was actually extremely helpful. to understand that you're not alone, and the thought processes and experiences you went through (or are going through) are not unique. unfortunately. i also started listening to a podcast (or youtube channel, rather) by craig kenneth, who seems to deal quite a bit with the aftermath of a relationship with an avoidant. ironically, the day i was listening to a segment on the phases avoidants go through after a relationship ends, she reached out to me. at this point it hadn't been terribly long, maybe a month. we weren't strictly no contact, spoken or unspoken, but had only texted once or twice in that span. and like he said she would, it was about something else entirely. but she asked how i was, and while people yell at me for engaging when i shouldn't, i responded. ironically, my ex (the avoidant in question) used to get upset that i would talk to my ex-wife, who cheated on me and did her best to nuke the relationship from orbit when she left. i have to co-parent so we have no choice but to communicate. so she knows (or should know) that if i respond to my ex-wife, who did me horribly wrong, out of politeness or duty then i will respond to her. anyway the conversation became ""friendly."" at this point i'm guarded, obviously. and while they say time heals, i think time removes the rose hue from your vision little by little, and you become more objective. so while you initially miss the relationship and romanticize much or all of it, as you are able to think about it more clearly you might understand it wasn't what you thought it was. so i'm not missing it nearly as much as i was. at the same time, i'm realizing that there's no good reason to be talking to me other than she misses me. it could be boredom or loneliness, but why me? i'm aware of this, mind you, and in talking to my friends (two women, actually) they both say she misses me, obviously, and might be fishing for something. so now it's been over two weeks of mostly small talk. why am i entertaining this? well, for one, i'm polite, and i don't like to ignore people. and i don't have the heart yet to say no more. though if i were to engage with a new love interest i would have to cut that off regardless of it being small talk or not. but i'm also very curious as to what she wants. i'm pretty sure she misses me. so i have been talking a bit, letting her do most of the initiating. i am not bringing up anything emotional or steering the conversation. she's alluded once to getting together with an implication of...well, you know. there's a small part of me, the eternal optimist, that wants her to have changed, even a little. that thinks she does miss me, and i'm waiting for her to bring it up, to try to address things, a path forward. but this would require her communicating openly about her emotions and ultimately risk rejection. this is \*not\* something avoidants do. so i'm engaging in otherwise pointless small talk waiting to see if she will address the elephant in the room, or if it really is nothing more than pointless small talk with no conceivable goal. maybe she hopes we'd get together, sparks would fly, and we'd just restart the same unhealthy push-pull cycle without ever addressing anything. the avoidant's dream, i suppose. but i'm not doing that. the moral of this story is in the title. avoidants don't change. or rather don't expect them to.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.01437908496732026,0.0,0.06013071895424837,2.0,0.0

"where i least expected it every time he broke up with me, he did it with a precision that hurt more than the breakup itself. it wasn’t just the goodbye—it was the way he did it. the cold tone. the empty eyes. as if i had never meant anything, as if all the moments we shared could be erased with a cruel snap of his fingers. he’d tell me he didn’t feel anything anymore, that he was tired of me, that i was too much. then he’d leave. just like that. and i’d fall apart. at first, i broke too. again and again. like a vase badly mended, shattering with each blow. but over time, each piece that fell off me also felt like a piece of him that no longer belonged. slowly, his face blurred in my memory, his voice faded. he had hurt me so deeply that, without knowing it, he pushed me to the edge—where i could finally see myself: wounded, yes, but alive. i began to love the parts of me where he used to live. and in the middle of it all, there was him… the florist. always kind, always calm, always there. he spoke to me with a tenderness that felt like it came from another world. he listened without interrupting. he didn’t ask for anything. he simply stayed. with flowers in his hands and sadness tucked behind his eyes—just like mine. we were both broken, but in each other’s company, there was something soft, something pure. without realizing it, we created a little space where we could breathe without fear. we held each other tighter when the past came back to haunt us. we laughed more quietly, as if pain had taught us how to speak in whispers. and one day, we realized: what we had between us was love. quiet, yes, but real. we didn’t say much. we just held hands. we weren’t in a rush. we both knew the last thing we wanted was to relive the past. but the ending wasn’t what i expected. one morning, he didn’t open the flower shop. i got worried. i knocked on the door. i called. i waited. days later, his sister wrote to me: he had left the country. an unexpected, sudden decision—but one he needed. he left me a short handwritten note. *""thank you for showing me i could still feel something beautiful. but i’ve realized i need to be alone for a while, far from everything. don’t look for me. take care. and keep blooming.""* i cried like i hadn’t cried for anyone before. not out of anger, not out of betrayal. i cried because i understood—not every love comes to stay. some arrive only to show us we deserve better… even if it’s not with them. and even though i was left alone again, i didn’t feel empty. because for the first time, in a long time, i had myself. whole. and not even the most unexpected goodbye could take that from me.",breakup,1,2649.0,524.0,7.5,0.01717557251908397,0.0,0.1049618320610687,0.0,0.0

"what was left among the flowers after the breakup, there was nothing left of me that i could recognize. it felt like every corner of my soul was in ruins, as if everything that was once light now burned to ash. i slept little, felt too much, and the days were just a sequence of emptiness i didn’t know how to fill. until, by pure chance —or maybe fate— i stepped into that flower shop. i was looking for a place where i could breathe without breaking. i didn’t expect it to be him. he was there, surrounded by living flowers while i was falling apart inside. his hands were stained with soil, and his soul seemed untouched by judgment. he looked at me with a kind of tenderness that didn’t hurt. he didn’t say much, but he offered me a flower. just one. it wasn’t the prettiest, but there was something about it… something broken and perfect all at once. i took it home like someone clinging to a tiny thread of hope. i went back. not because i wanted to see him —or at least that’s what i told myself— but because in that space, among roots and petals, the pain was a little easier to carry. he spoke of flowers as if they were people: of their cycles, their wounds, their quiet strength to keep growing even after being cut. i listened, and though my heart was still in pieces, his words were like water to dry soil. he never asked what had happened to me. he didn’t need to. he knew, the way flowers know when to bloom and when to close. and without promises, without grand gestures, without urgency… he held me. he saw me whole even when i could only see fragments. and i, afraid, uncertain, with wounds still open… began to feel again. not an explosive kind of love. something more raw, more gradual. more real. sometimes love doesn’t arrive like fire. sometimes it comes like a root: hidden, growing quietly, and before you know it… it holds you. he didn’t save me. i saved myself. but i did it because he reminded me how. because between the scent of flowers and the way he moved through the world, i understood i could still bloom. now i know that the loss wasn’t the end. it was the beginning of another version of me: stronger, softer, more true. i learned that even with a shattered heart, life can surprise you. that love can find you in the most unlikely places. that among flowers, soil, and silence… i was born again. and this time, i don’t need anyone to promise me forever. it’s enough to know that real love doesn’t demand, doesn’t wound, doesn’t shout. it simply *is*. and that… that changes everything.",breakup,1,2523.0,483.0,4.0,0.008281573498964804,0.010351966873706004,0.07246376811594203,0.0,0.0
"among petals and silences after my breakup, it felt like everything that had once bloomed inside me had withered. i walked through the city like someone wandering through a memory—aimless, hollow, hoping time would erase the pain. one day, without much thought, i stepped into a small flower shop. i wasn’t looking for anything in particular. maybe i just wanted to be near something that still knew how to live, how to grow. that’s where i saw him for the first time. he didn’t smile at me like someone trying to make a sale, but like someone who recognized another soul that had been broken too. he offered me a flower, just one. it wasn’t the brightest or the most exotic, but there was something in its simplicity that held me up. i took it, and unknowingly, i also took my first step toward healing. i came back, again and again. sometimes just to look at the flowers. sometimes to hear his voice gently explaining how every plant has its season, its wounds, its time to bloom. in those quiet moments, i understood that i, too, was allowed that—a winter, a pruning, a pause… and then, a spring. it wasn’t an instant romance or some grand cinematic story. it was something deeper, more real. we discovered each other like roots growing beneath the surface—slowly, respectfully. he showed me that not all love is loud; some is simply nurtured. and i, with every petal that fell from old memories, made room for something new. i wasn’t looking for love. i didn’t want to fall again. but love—true love—doesn’t always come crashing in. sometimes it arrives as a kind gesture, a carefully chosen flower, a conversation without expectations. and without realizing it, i began a new story—not like the last one, but better. because this time, i wasn’t a broken version of myself. i was someone who had learned how to bloom again. i’ve come to understand that endings aren’t always losses. sometimes, they’re doorways. and love—real, quiet, healing love—can find you even among petals and silences, when you least expect it… and when you need it most.",breakup,1,2048.0,376.0,3.0,0.007978723404255319,0.018617021276595744,0.06648936170212766,0.0,0.0

"what remains after in the end, it wasn’t love that i lacked—it was learning how to give it to myself. i was broken, confused, clinging to a “we” that no longer existed. i lost myself looking for him in memories, until i understood that the only thing real was the present—and me within it. letting go wasn’t easy. i fought against the urge to go back, against the idea that maybe things could’ve been different. but with time, i learned to breathe without him. to laugh without guilt. to be alone without feeling lonely. i learned that some goodbyes aren’t spoken out loud—but they echo in the soul. today, i remember him with warmth, not pain. there are days when his name still crosses my mind like a whisper, but it no longer breaks me. it simply reminds me that i loved truly, and that i was strong enough to move on. i loved him deeply. maybe a part of me always will. but i love myself, too. and in the end, that’s what remains. that—and the quiet hope that what’s coming, though different, can still be beautiful.",breakup,1,1020.0,198.0,3.0,0.015151515151515152,0.015151515151515152,0.09090909090909091,0.0,0.0

"got broke up by someone who is an avoidant. i (m24) got broken up with by someone who i honestly thought i’d spend the rest of my life with. we were together for over a year, and the past couple of months have been nothing but emotional torture. i have an anxious attachment style, and he’s avoidant. he wasn’t always like that, but looking back, there were times he was hot and cold. we had so much fun together, and i loved him with all my heart. i prioritized him in every way. i missed him the second we were apart. and he seemed to feel the same way. we’d argue sometimes, but we’d always make up and move forward. until a couple of months ago, when everything changed. but looking back, there is common theme. as i said, he was hot and cold. i would be showered with love and affection, then he would go cold. during the cold periods, i would be begging for the tiniest gestures like checking in or just acknowledging that i texted. i would be starved of emotional connection and be left feeling alone even though he is next to me. but i put up with it and waited. i never gave up because i had hope after bringing up and being told that he would put more effort. until a month ago. he started texting way less and would leave my messages unopened for hours. he stopped asking to see me or even call to check in. we weren’t intimate for over a month and when i tried to communicate that, i was left feeling terrible. he even flipped his sleep schedule so he’d be awake when all night and sleep during the day, which meant we barely talked at all. it felt like he was avoiding me on purpose. i kept trying to bring it up, telling him how distant he felt, but he either brushed it off or said he was just tired or stressed. i felt like i was losing him bit by bit. then he finally broke up with me. i’m completely shattered. everything around me reminds me of him. i still love him so much, even though i’m badly hurt. i can’t stop thinking about how amazing he was in the beginning, when he was loving and attentive and made me feel like his whole world. i just want to say this for anyone else who’s anxiously attached: be careful with avoidant people. at the start, they show you this version of themselves that makes you fall so hard. but slowly, they start pulling away and becoming distant, and you’re left feeling like you’re chasing after the person they used to be. the highs feel incredible, but the lows are honestly devastating.",breakup,1,2444.0,477.0,7.0,0.014675052410901468,0.0041928721174004195,0.0880503144654088,0.0,0.0

"watching my ex emotional breakdown was amazing. long story short childhood friends who went our separate ways and met in our 20s again. i wound up buying a house shortly after our lease had ended. i had a gut feeling during that time period she was planning something i wasn’t informed of. we dated for 5 years and lived together. the weirdness started happening towards the end of our lease and after confirmation on the house. well come to find out she met a girl while gaming who looks normal at first glance but is probably destructive and manipulative somehow talked her into being roommates for a year across the country. this is really weird to explain or put into words but the morning of the day she told me that i had started deleting all of our old saved snapchat conversations and imessages. going behind my back and not being a surprise party is cause to relationship termination in my eyes. ill save you a long story but in her head, her friend had convinced her she can take a break from the relationship to “go be young.” in their late 20s. terrible life choice btw and that i’ll probably still be around. watching the emotional breakdown play out when she’s asking why i was deleting memories was fun. i don’t think she had fully cemented her idea into going but i gave her no other option since her income alone isn’t enough to rent locally to where we lived. she used the excuse of staying at her parents and visiting before moving as an excuse to contemplate. she’s basically homeless, jobless and penniless from what i’ve heard and is now involved with very questionable people/circumstances as her parents cut her off due to her indecisive nature. the downfall of someone looking to emotionally scar you and financially use you after getting involved with a tainted person is great!!! i’ve also found out she’s resorted with her “new friend” of entertaining men for money. my ex had a good job for a travel company and then in tech and is now giving entertainment to make rent. a small part of me is sad that my kind and smart childhood best friend went down that path, but to go behind my back my put that before a sustainable easy life is rewarding karma. it’s one of those situations where you never truly know someone or they change? either way i couldn’t imagine having someone you could trust in your life and financially/career wise helped you succeed to doing sex acts to make rent. what a human pile of trash i wasted a decade of my life with.",breakup,1,2474.0,459.0,4.0,0.008714596949891068,0.004357298474945534,0.06318082788671024,1.0,0.0

"i ended a one year relationship, because she didn't want to be exclusive. a week ago i (m33) ended a one year relationship, because she (f34) didn't want to be exclusive. when we met each other, i was actually in a non-exclusive relationship with someone else, and it was quite difficult for me as that other girl would both see many other people and interact with me in a very couple-y way. so we started as non-exclusive and she kinda became my ""feel good"" relationship compared to the other, ""fury-passion"" one. with her i felt emotionally secure and it was just very sweet. so when the fury-passion one left me 10 months ago because she had met someone with whom she pictured a future together, i felt quite vulnerable and the feel-good relationship became a place where i could find solace. the relationship was very good, sex was amazing, and everytime we had a little talk about the relationship she said she wasn't seeing anyone else. except at one point, when she told me she'd seen someone for a month but it didn't work out ; it was already past, so i didn't make more of it. in winter she said she was like in a little cocoon and wasn't especially interested with meeting new people, but still wanted to be non-exclusive, and that was fine with me, as i wasn't sure about committing with her either. for all the beginning of this year both of us still weren't seeing anyone else. we were messaging each other every day, seeing each other once a week, and i just started to really like her, feel at ease with her, feel emotionally secure. she even invited me to spend time at her friend's house in italy during the summer holidays. so when one month ago she un-invited me, saying she wasn't comfortable as we never travelled together and this was her girl-friends-trip etc, i was kinda hurt. it felt like she wasn't trusting me to behave or something. so we had another talk about the relationship, and that's when she told me she had met someone new. didn't even kiss him or anything, just met him and was messaging him. well, hearing that kinda fucked me up. of course i knew we were non-exclusive, but none of us had been seeing someone else for months at that point. i suddenly felt very insecure and asked to understand more what i was to her. she said i was her ""relationship"" and she doesn't do multi-relational. so it's like, i'm the main guy, but she likes being open to new encounters. this whole thing made me feel very bad and i started to realized everything had been going so well for months because even though we were non-exclusive, we weren't seeing anyone else and that made me feel very secure and appreciated. a week later i offered her to be exclusive. to which she said no. ideally she wants a couple in the future, but right now she's good in her life as is, and she doesn't picture going further with me. well that burnt like hell. after one year, after so many intimate moments, after us being present for each other during hard times, hearing that didn't feel good at all. so a week ago we saw each other and talked about it again. i just had to ask her whether she had met with the other guy again. she said yes, and they kissed. well, upon hearing that i understood i just couldn't do it. for me, making love is now synonym of making it with her, kissing is kissing her, she ended up taking so much space in my life without me even looking for it. after one year, it's just too hard to think she does the same with someone else as she does with me. it's like it's meaningless now. so we had to accept the truth : it wasn't possible for me anymore if she was seeing someone else at the same time, and it still wasn't possible for her to be exclusive with me, as for her it's being a couple and she doesn't see that with me, at least for now. we both cried. i feel weird. and at the same time it's a weight that's off my shoulders. i'm sad, i miss her. but she made her choice too and i don't see how i could continue, considering how much this relationship has come to mean for me.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,2.0,0.002621231979030144,0.003931847968545216,0.0799475753604194,0.0,0.0
"rollercoaster: pregnancy, miscarriage and sudden break up this is a bit of a long story. i met my ex in december of last year (2024), we dated until march. we met on a dating website, i joined the website out of curiosity. she caught my eye, and we hit it off right away over messages and met within a couple weeks in person. we shared a lot of the same interests and passions. the only thing that was a bit difficult was, she is a young mother. she has a 1 and a half year old daughter. that along with about an hour geographical distance. she lived about 40 miles north from me. she's 20 years old, and i'm 24. it felt a bit stressful entering into that potential reality of entering a serious relationship with a child involved, especially because i'm still in school (started college late) and we are both still figuring out our life directions and so on. either way, our first couple of months of dating were passionate, fun, tumultuous and confusing. we certainly shared a connection and it was very special. she is an incredibly thoughtful, creative and caring person, who has experienced a lot of misfortune in her life. we both have semi unconventional attitudes towards the world. interested in self-sustainability, intentional communities, minimalism, agriculture/growing your own food, ecology, the arts, social and climate justice. we seemed like a great match in so many ways. yet regarding her child, i felt an inner conflict of whether or not this was what i wanted, in some ways i saw her being a perfect partner, in other ways i felt this dissonance of uncertainty. i was very upfront about my inner conflict and uncertainty with her, and she communicated that she was open to continuing exploring the relationship, even amidst my uncertainty. this was my first relationship in 7 years (since adulthood) and i know one of my weaknesses is taking relationships too seriously right off the bat. it was something that was conditioned when i was younger by my parents. this sort of mentality can suck the joy of just ""getting to know"" someone and insert a lot of anxieties like ""is this the right person??"" we both felt strongly attracted to one another and there was a lot of joy in the relationship even amidst some of the emotional instability. as the relationship deepened and became more intimate, i hit a breaking point in the middle of march. during a panic attack, i called her and told her i wanted to break up. i then offered to sit down in person a few days after and just talk about things and try to find some closure. i came to the conclusion that i didn't have the bandwidth to manage the relationship at this time, that as much as i liked her and desired to continue the relationship, it just didn't seem like the right time. she was heartbroken, but understood and it felt like we ended on a good note. she said that ""her door would always be open"" if i ever felt like revisiting the relationship down the road. following the breakup i was tortured with regret. feeling like i gave up too soon, and made a mistake. i was very heartbroken even though i was the one that ended everything. flash forward to may, i receive a message from her (she asked to go no contact) saying ""hey i know we went no contact but i need to talk to you about something, it's important"". we had waited to be sexually active and only had sex once, it was without protection due to it being sort of ""in the moment"". foolish i know. immediately my mind goes to ""oh shit, she's pregnant"". sure enough, she was 9 weeks pregnant--almost tracing exactly to the day we had sex. to be honest, i felt oddly at peace. when we met up to talk about everything, i felt so happy to be in her presence again, to talk with her and laugh with her. it obviously was a stressful situation, but it felt perhaps like fate, and that something was falling into place. we both didn't want to abort the child, so we agreed to talk about the options. adoption, co parenting or doing it together as a couple. we wanted to take our time and process our emotions and make a smart decision. she stressed that she didn't want me to start the relationship again just because of the child, she didn't want me to feel pressured to be in a relationship i didn't want. but we both said that our ideal situation would be raising the child together as a couple. about 2 weeks later, we made the decision that we could start the relationship again and aim to raise this child together. so many emotions, but overall i was feeling hopeful, and that it wasn't the child that was making me restart the relationship, but the pregnancy did reorient my mentality towards having a family and being a father, which sort of broke down the wall of hesitation i had the first time around dating her. at this point, the universe had chosen this path for me, and i was going to accept it and see it as possibly the greatest gift of my life unfolding. we both seemed to be keeping our chins up and began to daydream about the future. feeling like we were aligning in what we wanted our futures to look like, the strengths we share as a couple and how we would make a great team. a week later, she miscarried (at 12 weeks). this obviously hit hard, a total emotional rollercoaster. in the aftermath of the miscarriage, i told her ""everything we talked about regarding our relationship, aren't any less true now that the child is gone. we should continue this relationship"". now feeling more certain and realistic about the relationship, i knew i wanted to continue exploring it, now with the pressure of having a child off the table. she shared the same view and we continued to see each other. she was carrying a lot of grief from the loss, and i was trying to be sensitive and strong for her. it felt like things were falling into place, we were spending a good amount of time together, most weekends and maybe once or twice during the week. in her personal life, she was dealing with a lot. she was finally settling on a custody agreement with her daughters father (it was an abusive situation and she had been the sole caregiver for her daughter--until the courts decided 50/50 custody in june), she had been out of work for a few weeks, and trying to decide what direction she wanted to take with school/career. amidst all of this we had been making plans, i finally met her parents/family, she was spending more time around my family and she asserted to become ""facebook official"" lol. things seemed to be going well, even amidst all the messiness of what had just happened in the past month and a half. until one friday two weeks ago. we signed up to run a 5k together, had trained for it, and i was planning to go to work, and drive to her place after work/spend the night and run the 5k with her in the morning the next day. until i received a text. ""i've thought long and hard about how to say this, and writing it is the best way i can express my true, clear feelings..."" yup. a breakup text. just like that. out of nowhere. she gave several reasons. i'm a christian, i attend the episcopal church, i'm generally a more ""liberal"" christian, but still very passionate about my faith, theology etc. she had been baptized the summer before and had considered herself a christian, but was on the fence about a lot of things. she is also native american, and felt a dissonance between her cultural faith traditions and christian teaching, struggling sometimes to integrate them. rightly so, and i had tried to be sensitive to this, being open to having theological conversations, but eager to learn and understand her native beliefs also--and generally gave the vibe of being willing to compromise wherever she felt needed. she just didn't communicate about this, she had shown interest in the episcopal tradition, and we attended some services together and even after we broke up the first time she continued to apparently attend the episcopal church. she had said ""it was the first church experience i had where i felt i belonged"". in her text, different spiritual paths were her first reason, she felt that we would never be on the same page about faith/religion and were moving in different directions. she saw that i was passionate about my faith, but felt she couldn't meet me there. (once again, she never brought these concerns to me before this). her second reason was feeling overwhelmed by life and not having time to properly grieve the loss of the child. that was essentially her breakup message. she said i didn't do anything wrong and i inspire her everyday by how i care for others and how my faith guides me through life. she thanked me for everything. end of message. i was completely blindsided. shocked. angry. confused. i sent her several messages saying ""i understand you're going through a lot right now, and i can give you the space you need, but could we please talk more about this in person before we end everything?"" after leaving me on read for awhile, she responded that she can't do that, and she was sorry for how she dropped this on me the way she did. the next day i sent another message saying i want to fight for this, and that i'm hurt how she wants to end the relationship with one text without being willing to at least talk about these things. at that point she sent another message reaffirming her first points, adding that she hasn't felt alignment with our future goals and sees the geographical distance getting in the way of things. ""as much as i wish i could see past those things, i just don't see it working out long term. it's not fair to keep entertaining this between us. i haven't been honest with myself or you."" i attempted one more time, asking to at least sit down and end things with some closure and a conversation, so that i wouldn't fight anymore. i just wanted to understand. ""i'm sorry for dropping this on you the way i did, but i'm not interested in talking about it anymore. this isn't a decision i'm unsure about or planning on revisiting. it's over for me. i care about what we had, but i'm not in the place to continue discussing it. i'm sorry."" at this point i accepted she wouldn't budge and sent a heartfelt message thanking her for the relationship and affirming the wonderful things about her and our time together. she left me on read and blocked me everywhere. i've been crippled with heartbreak. i've never experienced pain like this before. i don't understand. it came out of nowhere. did i do something to cause this? i've replayed moment after moment in my mind. after the miscarriage she said ""i'm still willing to move to your city, what do you say?"" i hesitated and suggested that it might be best to put the brakes on some of the plans we made when we were expecting the child. i didn't want her to uproot her life just for me, someone she's only known for 6 months, plus with the custody situation it would've been an hour drive for pick up/drop off. i've wondered if that made her feel like i wasn't truly committed? in so many ways i tried to affirm that i was serious about continuing the relationship, yet i didn't want to make any long term commitments that i wasn't certain i could keep. i just wanted to allow the relationship to grow naturally, once the miscarriage happened. everyday i wake up with a pain in my chest, anger, and sadness. i feel incredibly mad about how she ended things. unwilling to sit down and look me in the eyes and say what she needed to say. we continued to be physically intimate (protection and precaution this time of course) and everything i was receiving from her was green flags that she had feelings for me and desired to continue the relationship. i feel like she ripped my heart out, spat on it and trampled it. in one of her messages she said ""i've been sitting with these things for awhile, and i know it's over for me"". yet she didn't feel it worthwhile to communicate these things? instead just going along with everything? so utterly confused and heartbroken. i don't know what to do. if you made it this far, thank you for reading. i just needed to get it all out. if you have any thoughts, support or questions i'd love to have some connection. i've been really low. a pain i've never felt before. it felt like a surreal dream. and now i'm on the other side, feeling like ""what the fuck just happened?"". hope you all are well and getting through whatever heartbreak y'all are experiencing right now.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.008459483526268923,0.0013357079252003562,0.07524487978628673,5.0,0.0

"i broke up with my boyfriend — he loved me, but it still felt like i was carrying everything. am i wrong for expecting more? okay so, i broke up with my boyfriend recently. it wasn’t some dramatic falling out or cheating issue — i just got tired. tired of feeling like i was doing all the emotional labor, like i was constantly adjusting and explaining myself while barely getting the same energy back. to be clear: i know he loved me. i never doubted that. but the way he showed it just didn’t land. he’s very prideful — only child, used to doing things his way, not super expressive through actions. like, yes, he’d say “i love you,” and yes, he’d make time to see me… but that was pretty much it. no initiative, no thoughtfulness, nothing extra. it always felt like i had to spell everything out for him. even stuff like bringing something when he first met my mom? nothing. valentine’s? nothing planned. monthsaries? never remembered. and when we ate out, it was always kkb. meanwhile, i was bending over backwards trying to adjust. i struggle with expressing emotions, yes, but i tried. i communicated, i gave what i could through my love language, and i really cared. i was never a perfect girlfriend, but i was present. and eventually, i just got tired of giving effort while always having to lower my standards to match what little i was getting. and then i realized: this is why i wanted him to court me in the beginning. i wasn’t being pa-hard or traditional — i just wanted to know if he was worth taking a risk for. i was going through a lot at the time, and i needed reassurance before jumping into something serious. he didn’t get that. for him, “if you like each other, go for it.” and i went along with it, but now i wish i hadn’t. because the whole relationship felt like i was the one doing the convincing — of myself and of him. i told him all of this. his response? “i’m sorry i hurt you… but i still don’t fully get it.” and that’s when it really hit me. he probably never will. and maybe that’s why i was never fully expressive with him — deep down, i didn’t feel safe to be. because i didn’t feel chosen, i didn’t feel seen. i felt like i was just there, and he thought that was enough. i don’t hate him. i know he tried — but it wasn’t in a way that made me feel loved. it made me feel alone. so i left. but now i’m here wondering: was i wrong for expecting more effort from someone who says he loves me? is it wrong that “time” wasn’t enough for me? was i asking for too much?",breakup,1,2501.0,492.0,5.0,0.01016260162601626,0.01016260162601626,0.12804878048780488,5.0,0.0

"after a year of silence, something just happened today. would love your take after hearing my story. it’s been almost a year since the breakup, and after everything i’ve gone through, i just need to share my story, and ask for your perspective on something that just happened. i was in a relationship where i gave 100% of myself: emotionally, financially, mentally. i supported her when she had no one: paid for groceries, tuition, rent, took care of her lifestyle, and stood by her during her lowest moments. i never expected anything in return, just loyalty and love. i was completely blindsided when she dumped me; no warning, no conversation, no explanation. just gone. left me on the floor crying, begging for her not to walk away. and even then, i didn’t know the reality. it wasn’t until later that her roommate told me things that opened my eyes and the closure my soul needed to stop sabotaging myself further as my love was genuine and real unlike her. so, she had been talking about me behind my back during the relationship: “he’s rich, he’ll pay,” and “don’t worry, he’ll forget if you don’t pay him. he’ll cover everything, he always does,” “he has a better lifestyle, so i’ll just take that.” that broke me in million pieces cz i never looked at her that way. i was used. i was a convenience, lastly i was betrayed. i don’t understand how she moved on within the same week, no grieve; filling the void of me with other guys and sleeping with them while i was left in pieces, sabotaging, trying to find my soul. i took therapy, not because i was weak, but because i wanted to find myself again, to heal and reconnect with my pure soul: not just for my own peace, but so that one day, when i date or love again, i’m healthy enough not to project my past pain onto someone else’s daughter. unlike my damaged ex who is stepping into other people’s life to fill that void and break them in pieces without fixing herself. thought i could save her or fix her. then my best friend told me, this song is made for you dawg: no role modelz - j. cole my therapist later explained that people like her often show signs of covert narcissism or emotionally avoidant behavior, they feed off others, lack empathy, and discard people when they’re no longer needed. that hit hard, but it helped me let go. i was ready to take bullets for her, and she turned out to be the one pulling the trigger. i realized that people like that don’t love, they damage. over the past year, i’ve rebuilt myself, therapy, self-reflection, setting boundaries, and finally learning my self-worth. i’ve gone through hell and back, but i made it. and i promised myself i would never let someone treat me like that again. after a full year of silence, she suddenly texted me: “hey my name, i know you might not respond, but i just wanted to check in , i hope everything’s alright back home. and to make sure you’re doing okay too” i’m not responding, because i’ve healed, and i won’t reopen a chapter that nearly destroyed me. but i am curious: what does a message like this usually mean? * is it guilt trip? * a realization of what she lost that was once real love she never had? * or is it just fishing for a reaction to see if i’m still reachable? * or she’s being real? * do i still hear her thoughts if we ever cross paths again, (we live on the same street but haven’t once since the breakup; god’s plan), now that i have the power to stay detached/moved on and see the mask behind the face? would love to hear your thoughts, especially from anyone who’s dealt with exes more or less like this. thank you for reading this long, means lot, and much love 🙏 just closing off by saying i will not reply and i will move on with my current life, because i truly deserve better. thank you everyone for the support and this channel.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.02203856749311295,0.01652892561983471,0.09641873278236915,5.0,0.0

"burnout breakups and mixed signals he broke up with me 6 weeks ago. we both got burnt out, he is avoidant and i’m anxious so it showed up in different ways. the first 2-2.5 years of our almost 6 year relationship were amazing. then it slowly started to fall apart with the last 2 years being very on and off in terms of affection and our general happiness. he has a porn addiction that spiraled into affecting my self esteem and my mental health, which then made his avoidance and porn addiction worse. we really tried, literally just a few weeks before he broke up with me we had a discussion about his porn addiction and he had said he could see and wanted a future with me still. but the burnout was too strong and neither of us had the energy or knowledge on how to fix the relationship in meaningful ways. he said he loves me like a friend still, and that he had to turn off his love for me so he could initiate the break up. it’s weird and confusing for me, because he’s currently acting warm and is offering me updates on his daily life. he bought me a couple of drinks that he was having a hard time finding, was all excited saying “look what i fooouund”. he asked how my tattoo was heading and showed me the one he got yesterday. just overall more than someone typically is when interacting with the person they recently broke up with. when i asked if he’d consider taking a break right after the breakup he said he wouldn’t consider dating me again for at least 5 years. i asked him a week later why that hard limit, long time frame and he said he simply likes multiples of 5 and so it sounded like a good number to say. a week after that we talked and i brought up the hypothetical of if he does start to have regrets since turning love off doesn’t always last forever, and he said that he already decided that he made his bed and had to lie in it, so he has to deal with the consequences even if it hurts him. i said he didn’t need to keep walls up if our friendship seems to be leading to dating again, and he said he would keep that in mind. i now know that this breakup was necessary so we can heal ourselves without having to worry about healing a relationship at the same time. i just hope that once we heal that we both will want to try again, but with the ability to properly support a relationship. he moves out in a bit over a week. i’m sad but i think no contact for a hit will be good for us, especially with his current extra warm behaviour than a dumper typically would be showing.",breakup,1,2506.0,489.0,7.5,0.018404907975460124,0.0081799591002045,0.07157464212678936,0.0,0.0
"may 4th what i did on may 4th wasn’t okay. i crossed a line. i was angry, humiliated, heartbroken, and pushed past my limit and i snapped. i wasn’t thinking about right or wrong. i was thinking about making her feel even a fraction of what she made me feel. i wanted her to feel exposed, embarrassed, and stripped of control because that’s exactly how she left me: discarded, accused, silenced, and erased. she got to walk away clean, spinning the story in her favor while i was still sitting in the wreckage wondering what the hell just happened.but i see it clearly now. that moment didn’t come from strength. it came from pain i didn’t know how to carry. and that pain turned me into someone i don’t want to be again. i’m not proud of how i handled it but i also refuse to hate myself for reacting like a human being who was deeply hurt. i don’t owe her anything. not forgiveness. not contact. not peace. but i owe myself something. i owe myself the choice to stop letting her pull me back into her story. i don’t need to fight for truth anymore. i just need to live in it.what happened was ugly but it wasn’t senseless. it came from betrayal abandonment and manipulation and i reacted. that version of me doesn’t need to be erased. he needs to be understood. and now that i’ve faced him i know better. i won’t lose myself like that again. she doesn’t get to define me by my lowest moment. do i regret it? no i don't. because a part of me hopes that she felt even a fraction of the pain she made me feel.",breakup,1,1507.0,303.0,4.0,0.013201320132013201,-0.013201320132013201,0.11551155115511551,1.0,0.0
"advice from a man who lived it to every man out there every guy who’s lucky enough to fall in love, truly and deeply, listen to me. if you’ve ever looked at her and knew she was the one… if you felt that burning certainty in your chest, that voice in your soul that said, “i’d give everything for her,” pause. breathe. and be honest with yourself first. because love… real love… isn’t just about feelings. it’s about readiness. emotional. mental. financial. these aren’t just words. these are the foundations of what it means to be a man. you are the man. you are her protector—her safe space. you are the provider—not just of money, but of peace, of security, of trust. and let’s not forget: god created us as men to face the world. he gave us the strength—physical strength to build, to carry, to lead… to build the world and rebuild it again if needed. but he didn’t stop there. he gave us the mental strength to carry responsibility—to protect, to lead, to guide. to carry our families on our shoulders with faith, with wisdom, with purpose. so if you’re not ready— if you’re still figuring yourself out, if your heart is full of chaos, if your pockets are empty and your mind is unsure— tell her. don’t hold her hand with one foot out the door. don’t let her build castles in the sky while your foundation is still sand. don’t use her love as a comfort zone while you search for direction. because the moment she realizes she’s building alone, the moment she stops feeling safe in your arms, you’ll lose her. and that kind of loss… it doesn’t just break your heart. it breaks you. i know. because i lived it. i had the kind of love most people spend their whole lives searching for. she wasn’t just a chapter. she was the whole book. and i ruined it—not because i didn’t love her, but because i wasn’t ready to carry the love i’d found. i was too fast. too caught up in the rush. in the excitement. in the fire. but fire burns when you don’t know how to hold it. and i burned her… and i burned myself in the process. so hear me, man to man: don’t enter a love like that unless you’re ready to honor it. to fight for it. to protect it with everything you are. because if you lose a woman like that— a woman who truly believed in you, who gave you her soul with open hands— you don’t just lose her. you lose the best version of yourself that existed when she loved you. and that… is a loss you will feel for a lifetime.",breakup,1,2422.0,488.0,1.0,0.0020491803278688526,0.028688524590163935,0.036885245901639344,0.0,0.0

"breaking up with someone is worse than being broken up with i broke up with my boyfriend this week, and it was absolutely horrible. i knew i had to do it because we just aren’t compatible in that way. i still love him and want him in my life, just not in a romantic way. and of course, now my brain is stuck on all of the good memories and trying to convince me that i made a mistake. i know i didn’t, but it’s still awful to feel that way. i think it’s easier to be broken up with because it’s not your choice. you don’t have to wonder if you made a mistake and shouldn’t have done it. you don’t have to cause someone so much pain. our breakup conversation broke something inside of me. he is still my best friend, and it’s killing me to not text him about my day. i do really miss him and this causes me to fear i made a mistake. i don’t think that i did, but it’s really hard to accept that when it was my decision to make.",breakup,1,926.0,200.0,5.0,0.025,0.005,0.12,0.0,0.0
"he left after 7 years, not sure how to navigate this… my partner of almost 7 years left yesterday. he got off the plane in my city at 10pm, and walked away down my street at 2am, without looking back after a final hug. about our story : he was my first love. we met at university, in his country (i live about 5 hours door-to-door from him in europe), and lived together for 2 years alternating between our respective flats. we didn’t see each other for a few months during covid and reunited after graduation when i moved back to his country to try and find a job there. it didn’t work out so i took it as a gap year to do a few internships, while i lived with a relative and then with him at his parents’ house. so another year of living together-ish. i moved back home to pursue a master’s degree as it offered better early career opportunities than i would have found in his country. it was meant to be temporary and i found a job at an international company with offices in his country so i’d be able to move there eventually if that was what we agreed upon. i always said that i’d love for him to try and come to my country and learn the language, at least to be able to share cultural references and engage with older members of my family. unfortunately, he found it hard and was very caught up with work (his job is intense with nights shifts and over the last year and a half he was also studying part time towards a qualification). we always tried to meet at least once a month for 3-4 days if not more, and make it as even as possible since i'd moved back home. as he got busier with work and studies (he sometimes wouldn’t be able to call for a few days and barely text due to his shifts and the stress generated by work - i was still the person he engaged with the most), my ego got the best of me and i would push back on visiting as i felt it was imbalanced. i now deeply regret it. i also deeply regret criticising his country and stating over and over how we’d be better off in mine. i regret arguing with him over closing the gap and making life plans, as he was always a ‘live day-by-day’ person. i feel like i didn’t give enough of a shot at living there considering i was the one who spoke the language and had the qualifications to work there. i thought he was my forever person, and never connected that way with anyone else. he was my best friend, made me feel safe and understood, made me laugh and feel loved. now i can’t help but wonder how he’s doing, what he’s up to, if he still thinks of us and misses me, if he too is crying in his room as i am. he was such a great person, friend, partner, lover. i don’t want to resent him or forget him but i feel like i’ll never be able to get over him and be stuck thinking i sabotaged it. he said he’d made his decision, that we tried and i had done nothing wrong. that unfortunately he most likely won’t come back and we’d grown apart. that we had different goals. that he felt he was dragging me along and if anything i’d done too well. i can’t let go of the hope he’ll reach out, that hurts a lot. and i feel like if i did reach out, in weeks or months, he’d find me pathetic and would’ve already moved on. or simply find me annoying or pity me. i can’t believe he’d think life would be better without me in it, even though to the last day we spent together he’d said i was a fantastic partner and it was a success, not a failure. that he loved me but not the same as before. i don’t know how to navigate this. i’m aware if we ever tried again it’d be a different relationship and we’d have to get to know each other again, but i would still take him back in a heartbeat. i’m replaying our memories, happy and sad, over and over in my head. i can’t believe it’s over. i guess i’m just here to vent and bleed my heart out… how do i navigate this? how do i resist the urge of reaching out, asking how he is doing?",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,2.0,0.0024968789013732834,0.009987515605493134,0.0986267166042447,2.0,0.0

"breaking up after an 8 year relationship. 33 and moving out on my own for the very first time. me and my boyfriend of 8 years are currently going through a breakup. we still live together and sleep in the same bed when we have to because it’s the only bed, but put up a divider of pillows between us. i’ve been looking for a place to move out on my own (and waiting to hear back from one that i love! 🤞🤞) and this will be the first time i’ve ever lived alone. i’ve always lived with family, or significant others. even when i was 15, i had a boyfriend that got kicked out of his place and my mom let him live with us for almost a year. one day when i was about 19, my mom kicked me out of the house, so i went to my boyfriend at the time’s house and lived with him for like 2 years. after that breakup ended, i came back home for a few months, and then that’s when i met my bf that we are talking about now. we are splitting up after 8 years. i moved in just a few months within the relationship and have lived in 3 different houses with him since. it’s hard because not only am i going to miss the type of relationship we had together, how well he knew me, just how comfortable we were with eachother, knowing each others sense of humor, knowing the worst parts of me but accepting them anyway, etc. it’s so hard. but i know we are not right for eachother and that it’s the right thing for both of us. we also have dogs together so that’s what makes it so difficult, too. but the other thing that i’m also trying to navigate through is moving out solely on my own for the very first time. i’m kind of excited, kind of nervous, scared for when i will get lonely, afraid if i run into any problems that i don’t have back up for in the next room, etc. i’m hoping i’ll be able to be completely financially independent and that’s another thing that terrifies me. does anyone have any kind words or advice for a newly 33 year old woman who’s going to be out on her own for the first time ever? because i’m kind of terrified.",breakup,1,2019.0,411.0,2.0,0.004866180048661801,0.009732360097323601,0.10948905109489052,1.0,0.0

"broke up almost a year ago; i'm unsure where my heart stands i’ve been hesitant to share this as i don't typically share things like this here... it’s personal, and still tangled up in emotion. but it’s been sitting heavy on my chest. i’m not looking for judgment, just honest insight from anyone who’s maybe been through something similar or can offer a clear perspective. **tldr;** together for just over 8 years, broke up in mid 2024 due to lack of intimacy, relationship imbalance, and no forward movement (no engagement, kids, or moving out of our bad apartment). still love him deeply and we remain close friends, we see each other often. i’m wondering if it’s worth trying again or if i’m just clinging to what’s familiar. looking for genuine advice, not judgment. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ i’m 29 (f), and i was with my ex (m, also 29) from november 2015 until i ended things in july 2024. almost a decade together. i broke it off for reasons i’ll explain below but now, nearly a year later, i’m still conflicted. i told him i didn’t want to get back together, and i believed it. but recently… i’m not so sure i meant it fully. people keep asking if we’re back together or heading that way. i just laugh and shrug it off but deep down, i don’t really know how to answer that. we’ve stayed friends since the breakup. we still see each other several times a week; errands, small hangouts, life stuff. our friend groups are small and quiet, and honestly, there’s a comfort in him that’s hard to shake. he was my best friend. he still kind of is. how do you fully let go of someone who was in your whole twenties? i’m not going to lay out every detail of our relationship because i don’t want this to feel like an attack piece on either of us; just a real moment, with the key things that led to the end: **intimacy** – there was hardly any. at one point, we were only having sex maybe once a year if that. i’d try to initiate, ask, plead... and still nothing. eventually i stopped trying altogether. that kind of distance hurts, and even though i know sex isn’t everything, for me it’s a necessary form of connection. i felt rejected and unwanted. **laziness** – we lived together, and i carried the bulk of it. the home, our two cats, the little life we shared; it all fell on me. i know i wanted to be a homemaker one day, but not like this. not when it felt like i was the only one putting in the effort. he acknowledges that he got lazy. i’d ask for help, and he’d do things late or half-heartedly. that constant imbalance chipped away at me until i felt numb. **stagnation** – there was no real growth. i’ve always been upfront that i wanted to eventually get married and have kids. i also hated the apartment we were in, it was run down, and i begged to move but he always wanted to stay or gave me little to nothing when i showed new places. i felt like we were stuck, and i was the only one trying to move us forward. i still love him. deeply. despite those big things. but i can’t forget the things that broke me. like finding open tabs of porn on his computer; not the content itself, but the *context.* we had no intimacy, no physical closeness, and he was still finding release elsewhere. meanwhile, i wasn’t even taking care of my own needs. it made me feel like a ghost in my own relationship. there was also jealousy around my male friends. i understand his insecurities, but i’ve always had mostly guy friends as i was a tomboy growing up. that’s just my social circle. and still, my loyalty never wavered. but now, after exploring a bit of dating, i find myself thinking about the past. no one else feels like him. he saw all of me… the weird, soft, sharp edged parts and never judged. he supported me in everything i did. he always believed in me. and that kind of acceptance is rare. we had real issues, and i’m not blind to my own flaws either. but i’m wondering... is it worth having a serious conversation? is there even a chance to rebuild something new from the ruins of what we had? or am i just being nostalgic, missing a comfort that feels safe, even if it wasn’t always good? before anyone jumps on me about the sex thing; yes, i know relationships aren’t all about that. and we *did* have soft, sweet moments without it… cuddles, gentle affection, emotional connection. i cherished all of that. but i also need touch. i need kisses, hugs, closeness. i need to feel wanted. so yeah... this is where i’m at. torn between memory and reality, love and logic. what would you do? i'm open to questions too if you need more information, hard to summarize nearly 9 years..",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.0136986301369863,0.010273972602739725,0.10730593607305935,5.0,0.0

"spiraled and spam called ex at 5am, don't be me for context, dated for 8 months, she fell in love first, i fell in love too. she would say how i was perfect and how i was everything she ever wanted. she said that when were together i gave her so much energy. it was perfect. she then wanted to join the navy, i supported this as any good bf would, but then she started to act all distant from me, not messaging or calling as much so i asked her what was up and she eventually said she wanted to break up because she didn't want to be in a relationship while in the navy and also didn't want to regret not 'having more fun' while she is still young, she's 25 and i'm 29 btw. so i was really upset and thought we could hook up casually until she left. from the break up convo i did not cope well, constantly looking at her socials, messaging her, we talked a little for about 10 days until i crashed out my sleeping has been all fucked up and i keep waking up at 4:30am. i downloaded hinge, this is where we both met, and guess who i find, yip it was her. she had in her profile that her ideal sunday was 'food, gym, bang' and that she wanted casual fun. i was on there too so can't really throw stones. so i went crazy, messaged her saying 'why cant we bang and gym a couple more times before you leave'. then i let the demons get the better of me so i called, she declined, i called again, she declined and then i called again. until eventually she said that it's because of the way i've been acting and that i should respect her choice. dont be me. probably the most embarrassing thing i have done. if you get dumped do not be me, do not call or message, especially at 5am. get used to the fact they will be getting with other people almost immediately after the break up and really focus on your own life. i've definitely ruined any chance of seeing/sleeping with her again so if that is something you are entertaining, do not be me. even if you are just trying to move on. do not be me. telling this story to help you feel better if you are in no contact as this is a prime example of breaking that rule only to look desperate, pathetic and only drive them further away. happy healing everyone.",breakup,1,2197.0,429.0,7.5,0.018648018648018648,0.011655011655011656,0.07459207459207459,0.0,0.0

"going through breakup with ex hi everyone, i’m a 26-year-old muslim man, and she’s a 28-year-old buddhist single mother of three. we got back together 6 months ago after 9 months of no contact. she was my first love, and i still love her deeply—even though she ghosted me the first time we broke up. after we reconnected, i found out she’s a sex worker, which i didn’t know before. i accepted her even after knowing the truth because i understand she’s doing it to support her family. and deep down, i hoped that if my business succeeded, i could help her leave that life. but now, she’s been sleeping with her ex and sometimes disappears for a day or two. she’s asking me to accept this because i can’t support her financially at the moment. it’s tearing me apart inside—i love her, but i don’t know what to do. i’m also feeling very lost. i’m struggling with my business, i have nothing right now, and i feel completely alone. she’s constantly on my mind, and it’s affecting everything. i can’t focus, i can’t think straight—just stuck in this pain and confusion. any advice or thoughts would mean a lot.",breakup,1,1106.0,219.0,7.0,0.0319634703196347,0.0182648401826484,0.1232876712328767,0.0,0.0
"from ‘i want to build a life with you’ to ‘i’m not ready’ — trying to make sense of it me(f,25) him(m,25) we met 6 months ago through an online game. we quickly became close and added each other on social media. back then, he was unemployed and struggling financially. i offered to help a few times, but he always said no. even so, he opened up to me, shared a lot about his life, and even told his family about me. his mom joked about making sure i wasn’t a scammer, and his parents helped pay for the car rental on his first visit to see me. before that trip, he got a job and thanked me for supporting him during hard times. he brought me several gifts and, after that trip, we both agreed to be exclusive—no dating or sleeping with anyone else. that first visit was beautiful. but after he left, things started to shift. he said work was overwhelming and he didn’t have as much time, though he kept insisting his feelings hadn’t changed. but then, he mentioned a new friend—his best friend’s sister—and it became clear he was spending more of his free time with her. they went to the movies, cooked together, hung out often. meanwhile, i kept asking for time, a call, or emotional connection, but i felt like i was no longer a priority. one incident really shook me. we had just agreed to notify each other of our plans out of respect. then, the very next day, he disappeared in the evening—without saying anything. turns out he had gone to the movies with her. i stayed up all night worrying. the next day he said he got home late and just passed out, not thinking it would be a big deal. that broke my trust. it hurt deeply, especially after our agreement. he said things like “i see a future with you” and “i still need you to design our house."" days before coming again. he came to visit me again this june. the week was intense, but he seemed emotionally distant—constantly on his phone, avoiding serious conversations. when i tried to talk about feelings, he’d say things like, “only women like talking about that,” or call my questions silly. he claimed we didn’t need to force deep conversations, that we should just talk about whatever came naturally. but i felt dismissed. eventually, i told him i felt disconnected. he admitted he felt it too but didn’t want to talk about it at that moment. later, when we were alone, he opened up. he cried as he told me: “i’ve been feeling off for a while. i thought seeing you again would help, but it hasn’t. i’m not ready for the responsibilities of a relationship. i’ve been in relationships since i was 17 with no time to heal. i need to focus on myself and my career. you’re beautiful, ambitious, everything i’d want—but i can’t give you what you deserve. i want to stay friends, maybe travel, but i can’t do more than that right now.” he said he still liked me a lot, appreciated me, and didn’t want to hurt me—but he needed to be alone for the first time in his life. he also confessed that in his last relationship, he didn’t want anything serious but agreed out of pride when the girl gave him an ultimatum. he admitted that he acted like he wasn’t even in a relationship, strongly suggesting he was unfaithful. he regrets how that went, and some things from both past relationships are still emotionally triggering for him. he told me that after his last relationship ended, i was the first person he really connected with again—and he didn’t want to mess it up. but now i’m left confused. he said he’s not ready, but still messages me, still wants to do our travelling plans, sends me money (like he did for my graduation event), and jokes about me dating other guys. he says, “i don’t want to be an obstacle for you to meet new people,” and that he would understand if i moved on. but then he also says, “let’s travel together again,” or that “it’s just a ‘see you later.’” tl;dr: met a guy online 6 months ago. we got close, talked every day, became exclusive, and he flew to visit me twice. he talked about a future together and even said i’d design our house. but after the second trip, he said he’s not ready for a relationship — he needs to heal, be alone, and focus on work. still, he keeps in touch, sends me money for things, and says he doesn’t want to lose me, and want to keep as friends. now i’m left confused. is he being honest, or just keeping me around? why not let me go completely? doubts (mine + my friends’): 1. does he truly need time alone to heal and work on himself, or is that just an excuse to push me away gently? 2. if he isn’t ready for a relationship, why did he invest so much time, emotional energy, and money into seeing me — even twice? 3. why talk about a future, make promises (like designing our home, future trips, etc.), and then suddenly change direction? 4. is he scared of commitment, or just not interested in committing to me specifically? 5. is he trying to make me do the ""ending"" so he doesn’t have to be the bad guy? 6. why does he say i should meet other people, as if he’s completely fine letting me go — does that mean he doesn’t care that much? 7. could there be someone else? is he trying to explore other options while keeping me around ""just in case""? 8. why does he say he doesn’t talk to his exes, yet wants to remain in touch with me? was i never that important to him? 9. does he really not want to lose me — or does he just not want to feel guilty about letting go? 10. why does he keep making flirty jokes about me dating again— is that carelessness or emotional detachment? 11. was i just someone to make him feel better while he figured himself out? i’d love to hear honest thoughts, especially from people who’ve said “i’m not ready for a relationship” — what did you really mean?",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.008204193254329991,0.0009115770282588879,0.07748404740200547,5.0,0.0

"replaced like a used rag (a little vent about my last relationship — if you have similar experiences or advice, please share) i’m a 22-year-old guy and i spent 10 months seeing a 20-year-old guy. our relationship had many ups and downs before ending in what i believe—after hearing other stories—is one of the most sudden and brutal breakups ever. it started as a friends-with-benefits situation with the rule that we wouldn’t tell each other about other people we were seeing. it was a kind of “out of sight, out of mind” arrangement. after about a month, he broke that rule by inviting me and another guy to an outing. we talked about it, but things didn’t change deeply—i continued seeing others, and i think he did too. in october, it happened again: he invited that same guy for a night out with me, and a weird thing happened that disgusted me. even so, we carried on. i still occasionally hung out with others without his knowledge. a major moment occurred in december when he went out with another guy who wanted more than just a one-off hookup—he wanted something serious, they started dating. after that, we stopped talking for about a month, during which we saw each other four times. after that chapter, he came back to me and the relationship took a more serious turn—we started dating with the intention to become boyfriends. i stopped seeing other guys and focused on him. he didn’t. fast forward to may: i saw him with someone else. he assured me it was just a friend, but in the following days i found out they’d slept together. that’s when the breakup happened. he told me there were problems between us (fixable stuff) and that he’d started seeing the new guy because he didn’t feel carefree with me anymore. the new guy made him feel happier, and he wanted to see where that would go. he asked me to wait for him—and wanted us to stay friends. he threw me away carelessly. a month has passed since our last confrontation; he’s reached out to me four times. he’s playing confused, making it seem like he still doesn’t know what he wants. we both went to a friend’s birthday party and during a game of truth or dare, someone asked if he had feelings for anyone in the group. he refused to answer. meanwhile, other friends tell me things with the new guy are going well—he didn’t hesitate to call him “boyfriend” after just two weeks. that’s huge considering it took him months to call me that. it was brutal. i felt used more than ever before. i’m struggling to accept the end, and i don’t know how to approach the situation or let go.",breakup,1,2553.0,487.0,2.0,0.004106776180698152,0.002053388090349076,0.07597535934291581,0.0,0.0

"we’ve been on & off for 3yrs… toxic or meant to be? hey guys. i need opinions. unbiased opinions. so, me and my ex have been on and off for 3 years. more on than off though, i will say. we started dating june 2022, dated for a year and went no contact for 5 months. we ended up getting back together for another 6 months. we went back into contact basically right after we broke up and haven’t stepped out of it since. we were basically together all last year into this year just without the title.. both times we broke up were for stupid reasons though. the biggest issues in our relationship was communication and outside influences. his friends have been a huge part in him making decisions based on his love life… which is a huge red flag, i know. i always put my foot down with this though, he tried putting his friends in our arguments and i always put a stop to it because their opinions don’t matterrrr and never did, to me at least lmao. so yea, basically we just went separate ways both times for stupid ass reasons, when we’re both still so in love. which is exactly why we keep coming back to each other. we’re both young still, early 20’s. but in a way it’s like we grew up together, we spent our entire beginning of our “real adult lives” with each other. planned on moving in together, having kids, whole 9. i have never in my life felt even closeee about anyone the way i do about him. since we broke up the first time i’ve tried with other people, i tried to be more open and give other people a chance but he’s always in the back of my mind. i dream of him almost every night, still even over 3yrs later. and from what he’s told me, he feels the exact same way. he’s constantly having dreams as well and he told me that he actually “doesn’t feel comfortable with anyone else the way he does with me, he’s never been so compatible with anyone in his life” and i full heartedly agree, unfortunately. fast forward to current day he’s back.😂😂😂 we’re trying to work on things… but i’m at the point where either we’re locking in fr this time or we’re going our separate ways fr. i can’t do this back n forth shit anymore, it’s exhausting. iykyk. but i’m willing to work through everything again, i’d rather try with him 200x than with someone new. i’m the type of person that believes relationships and love is built off shared time and experiences. we built so much in 3-4 years that it’s just so hard for me to let go. in the long run, i know 3-4 years is not a lot. but it feels like a lot, yk? i’ve never had anyone who was my best friend and partner all in one. i’d try anything to fix it. i know i sound delusional but it’s fine. 😇 lmfaooo yall what do i do… do i even give him another chance atp? after all the healing and self work i’ve done it’s definitely gonna take me back a bit… just not sure if it will be worth it in the long run.",breakup,1,2857.0,574.0,7.0,0.012195121951219513,0.003484320557491289,0.10278745644599303,3.0,0.0

"angry i don't know if this is normal or not, it's been a bit since me and my ex fiancé split, and every time i think about her i just get this urge to scream and punch stuff. maybe i should give a bit of context: me and my ex met a few years back. at first things were great and i thought that she was everything i ever wanted. i loved every single thing about her, so i end up proposing to her a bit after a year and a half. yes i'm aware that's soon. fuck it. but the thing is, that after that, after she said yes, that's when the problems started rearing their ugly head. at first it was small stuff like dismissing my sadness, telling me to deal with everything by myself, and not even wanting to listen to what was wrong because she would rather drink her brains out until she blacked out drunk, and if i tried to get her to stop drinking, she'd get violent. she'd throw bottles and choke me and hit me. you know, average everyday shit... but as time went on, she actively started insulting me toward anyone who would listen, her friends, her family... me.... at some point she started acting outright transphobic. keep in mind i'm trans. she knew i was trans. from day 0 she knew. but somehow it only became an issue after over 2 years. she started misgendering me, calling me a delusional man who needed to be locked up in a conversion camp. but eventually that led to her cheating on me with guy after guy after guy. each time it was a different dude. and if i spoke out i'd get hands thrown at me. keep in mind i'm only 5 ft 4, and she was taller and stronger than me. she worked out a lot. i don't. and that's just when i was about to leave. but that wasn't the end of it... no... of course not... but for me the final straw came one night when she decided she'd do a line of coke and... maybe i shouldn't say... i don't want to trigger any sa victims here... i guess my question is this: why is it that whenever i think about her i feel this combination of fear, anger, desperation, and pain. and why is it that my brain can only think to resorting to punching stuff to burn off the energy? what's wrong with me?...",breakup,1,2126.0,413.0,5.0,0.012106537530266344,-0.002421307506053269,0.08958837772397095,2.0,0.0
"i (23f) broke up with my bf (24m) of 3 years. i still miss him and cant stop thinking about him. i broke up with my boyfriend because we had some serious issues in our relationship. initially, he was perfect and the relationship felt too good to be true but eventually he started accusing me of things i never did (cheating, lying, meeting guys etc) i had zero guy friends and only hung out with my best friend, kept him updated through snapchat and was still the kindest to him even though the accusing part was draining me a lot mentally and physically. what started with accusing turned into obsession, he kept checking my phone everytime we met, accused me of cheating on him with every guy i knew (my classmates and even some of my cousins), he kept an eye on me and watched my every move. he contacted my ex and my ex told him things about me which were untrue and it took me 5 whole months to gather proofs to make my bf believe in me and have faith in me and not trust my ex. even after that, things didn't change, he asked me to send snaps of where i was every 10 mins which hindered with my studies and my lab work and if i didn't do that, he'd verbally abuse me and call me a cheater. i tried breaking up with him multiple times but he'd come back begging in front of me to take him back, asking to forgive him for his mistakes and for treating me badly and saying he'd change. being the lover girl i was, i always went back to him and forgave him, but the cycle continued. i wouldn't say i was a saint in our relationship, i did my share of mistakes but i made sure to change myself so that he feels safe with me. the more i made him feel safe, the more he started controlling me (he decided what id wear, where id go, whether ill go to the gym or not, i couldn't meet my(female) best friend because he was sort of jealous of her and much more) i broke up with him and we're on no contact now but i still miss him. i miss his smile, i miss all the good times we shared, i miss him rubbing my feet, i miss when he'd bring me tea and make me pasta after a long day, he tried changing for me but he couldn't. i could see him trying, i could see how hard he was trying but i don't know what i did wrong for him to treat me like that. he had no answer to this question as well. so i miss him, i miss him so so much because i love him, i loved him truly and truly cared for him. idk whether i should break the no contact or not, his last texts were that he's sorry and he'll wait for me but i asked him to move on and learn from his mistakes and he said he'll try moving on :)",breakup,1,2582.0,521.0,7.5,0.023032629558541268,0.011516314779270634,0.1420345489443378,0.0,0.0

"bro's fallen again hi, i'm new on reddit, i actually created my account to share my story, seeking for advices. i'm 28 years old man, i met her in summer 2018, i seduced her, i did my best to get her, and it happened, we became a couple few months later. two weeks after that, her dad passed away, i was there for her, everyday, everytime. we had good days, bad days, i wasn't the best for her, but i was working on my self to improve. we had small fights, we had our first kiss and so on. she wanted to keep her virginity for marriage, i respected her choice, and never did it. we fouled around so many times, that it almost happened. i knew she loved me, and i did too, she was jealous of other girls i was talking to (there were a lot), and i was jealous of boys around her, but eventually, no harm happened from the outside. 2020, 2021, the two full years were shit, lockdown, working again, lockdown, working again... after two years like that, i had a breakdown and quitted my job in 2022, i gained weight and depressed for many months, we broke up for a month in summer 2022, but get back together after that. the shit kept going for me, i couldn't get out of my situation, so we wasn't meeting a lot, once a month, at best. i was turning around in my life, i lose purpose of everything, i was trying to figure it out and couldn't handle a relationship, but i did my self and gave the bare minimum, it's never enough. summer 2023, we fought for some reason and she didn't text me for a month, she came back and asked to talk, i waited a month to accept ""her departure"" and the we got back together, again... i know that feelings and love fade away, from both sides, but we stick together, of the old good times, we didn't want to throw away what we had together, the future that we wanted to achieve. december 2023, we fought again and didn't talk for like 3 months, we eventually talked again in february, i had to make the first move and we got back together again. there was a new sparkle, we were more open and talked better, for the first time, we really opened up about everything. (sexuality obviously, even if we hadn't sex, we did other things), two months later, her mother was diagnosed with cancer, and she died two months later, so, i was here for here, more than ever, i drove here when needed, i cheer her up, and take care of her as best as i could. 2025, new year, same shit, i became absent again, less and less available, i was finally, getting back to my old self, i was ""recovering from the burnout"", i lost like 30kg and i started to feel good again, but, i eventually sacrificed some time with her, talking, calling, seeing each others... end of april, we fought for some shitty reason, she told me that she's done with me, i was angry so i let her talk, and i let her go. i waited and expected her to come back, to talk and sort it out. but, she never did, so do i. we remained friends on social media, but didn't talk for like two months. the first month, i regained some weight, i had to drown my pain, so i did eat and forgot about her. few weeks ago, i decided that it's over, i'm getting back to my life again, so i stopped all the patching up things, and for the first time in five years, i'm feeling good again, i got back to reading, to having a purpose, to see in front of me. and then, i started thinking about her, about us, and i was, and still am, disappointed. because she didn't come back for me, because of everything i've done for her, it wasn't enough, i wasn't worth it ? i don't know if it's love, care or just bruises of the past that keeping me down, but this last days were very hard, the only thing that kept me from talking to her was the idea of disappointment. maybe i'm right, maybe i'm wrong. few days ago, i noticed a new friend on her social media, someone living in another town, 100-150 km maybe ? (she doesn't have many friends on social media and don't accept invitations...), that's when it became harder for me. a lot of questions, of thinking, of everything... of trying not to talk to her and today, something happened. in the past two months, i didn't meet her, today, after my gym, i went to the supermarket and saw her in aisle, she passed just in front of me, and dropped her eyes down, i bought my things, paid, and couldn't go. so, i waited for her outside to have a talk. she was hostile, not smiling, and took me for responsible. we talked for like 30 minutes, and i just can't help it, i felt dissatisfaction. she was seeing me like an unknown asshole, and all the time we spent together was never happened, i was wondering, how in earth, something like that can happen, so quickly. we agreed to have a talk later and maybe to meet this week to sort things out. so, here i am, sharing my story, i don't know where i am. but, i feel like she moved on. i don't know if i just want to hurt her and get my revenge of all this disappointment, to move on. what do you think ? do you have any advices or ideas to share ? i'm not a saint, i did a lot of bad things too, most that she didn't know, which i had to live with. and maybe, i'm just releasing her from my dark web, maybe i'm the bad guy in the story...",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,2.0,0.002012072434607646,0.007042253521126761,0.11971830985915492,4.0,0.0

"my perspective as someone who moved on quickly from my last relationship hey everyone, i got curious and browsed through this sub and noticed a lot of people were asking why their ex moved on quickly after their relationship and i just wanted to offer my perspective. for reference i am a young male and the relationship i am in now with my girlfriend is by far so so much better than my last and i am so much happier now. i know i am young, and maybe still a little dumb but i just want to share my perspective as it may offer a different view point. my last relationship lasted 2 years and to be honest, was not the best relationship. i remember not really feeling that ""feeling"" towards her. i believe at the time i genuinely liked her, i just wasn't sexually attracted to her. she wasn't ugly or anything, i just didn't feel that feeling you get when you're with someone you are sexually attracted to. the best way i can describe it is that it was like kissing my sister. it just didn't feel good. i did, however, at the time, believed that it was just my fault i was like that. she was my first for a lot of things so i just didn't have a lot to compare to so i just assumed something was wrong with me. on top of this, we had a lot of arguments as well. she was a very jealous and insecure person which led to many issues regarding friends. about a year in the relationship, i went to lunch with my friend f and m in between class. i told her after the fact and she got so upset to the point where she was crying and yelling at me. i believe that was the point that the relationship changed forever and was the beginning of the end. i should've ended it there and it is one of my biggest regrets regarding that relationship. however i just couldn't do it and chose comfort over being uncomfortable for a while. fast forward another year, we had other moments like this and also more issues on top of that, i finally got to the point where i was so sick and tired of her i decided to end it. it was a mess. she was crying and yelling and it got so bad to the point where i decided to stay with her. i should've stuck to my guns but i just couldn't. a couple months after that she finally ended it with me and about a month later i met my current girlfriend and it's been the best ever since. i am so attracted to her i finally know what that feels like to be intimate with someone you love. we don't argue, and we both have our respective friends which we all know. i love her so much and if she broke up with me right now, i know for sure i would not be able to move on for a good while. sorry if this post got long, i just wanted to offer my perspective as to why i moved on so quickly and to maybe hear some feedback. if you have any questions feel free to ask i am open to answering.",breakup,1,2792.0,556.0,2.0,0.0035971223021582736,0.007194244604316547,0.11330935251798561,0.0,0.0
"the worst part of healing the worst part of healing isn’t the silence. it isn’t the tears. it isn’t the loneliness that crawls into bed with you at night. no. the worst part… is when you feel her soul everywhere you go. she’s in the streets i walk. in the songs that randomly play. in the food i used to love. in the air i breathe. even in the laughter of strangers passing by—somehow, some way, i feel her in it. it’s like the world refuses to let me forget her. and maybe that’s what’s breaking me the most. sometimes, i swear i want to run away. not just from her memory—but from myself. leave this country, this city, these streets. pack up my heart and move somewhere far, far away—somewhere her soul didn’t touch. but deep down i know… even if i stood on the other side of the planet, she’d still be with me. because healing isn’t about distance. it’s about facing the ghosts that live inside you. you know what hurts the most? trying to move through the world without the same fire i once had. when she was with me, i felt unstoppable. confident. powerful. like i could build an empire with my bare hands. she was the wind in my sails, the voice in my head that whispered, “you’ve got this.” and yes… it’s true what they say: behind every strong man, there’s a strong woman. but not just any woman— it has to be someone who believes in you. wholeheartedly. unconditionally. she was that woman. until she wasn’t. the day she stopped believing in me… was the day i stopped believing in myself. it was like someone had pulled the plug on my soul. no more spark. no more fire. no more pushing myself to be more. i used to go the extra mile—hell, i’d run marathons—just to see her happy. just to make her proud. now? now i do the bare minimum. just enough to get by. medium. average. lukewarm. nothing exciting. nothing new. no hunger. no passion. and that… that is the cruelest part of this healing process: losing the best version of yourself. not because life took it. not because time faded it. but because the person who brought it out of you is gone. i’m not just mourning her. i’m mourning me. the “me” that laughed louder. that loved harder. that believed anything was possible. so here i am… not just trying to forget her— but trying to find myself again. and that… is a heartbreak all on its own.",breakup,1,2308.0,453.0,7.5,0.017660044150110375,0.006622516556291391,0.06622516556291391,2.0,0.0
"i f24 am feeling lost after m25 left me, only to reconcile after sitting with himself for 3 months. need advice and insights. hi all, i’m feeling overwhelmed and unsure about where to go from here, so i’m hoping for some outside perspective. my husband and i recently gave up our city center studio apartment in may. it was expensive (€1400, though i managed to negotiate it down to €1000), and he was very adamant about moving out and finding himself again. he needed to be alone but mostly due to cost and lack of space. i had doubts about ending the lease, especially since it was unlimited and felt like our shared space, but i went along with it. considering we had painful talks about separating and how he felt like he wasn’t himself since september (job losses, depression etc.) and it all took a turn for the worse. i didn’t know about this until after and since i could barely listen to him and was dealing with my own job loss it was a recipe for disaster, so i am also to blame but i can see where we both went wrong and so does he. his cries for him not being himself anymore fell on deaf ears since i myself didn’t even know who i myself was anymore either. we had many heart to heart talks since then, i myself just have a hard time trusting and believing he won’t leave again in the future. we were disconnected for a a solid three months where we were barely speaking. think about one text a week to randomly check in. but once the lease ended, he slowly started helping again and even supported me while i moved back in with my parents. we’re now technically dating again and spending a lot of time together.. it’s to the point where he recently stayed over at my parents’ place. the situation is confusing. i don’t know where our relationship stands long-term, and being back in my childhood room, surrounded by family opinions and expectations, is really hard. they have a right to voice this of course but it is messing with my head. i feel like a ping-pong ball between what everyone else thinks i should do. meanwhile, i’ve been offered a job in greece (apple support role). it’s not amazing, but it pays €1000 net and includes free accommodation for the first few months. part of me wants to go… not because it’s a dream job, far from it honestly considering its customer service / sales, but because i feel overwhelmed by everyone around me. i crave space, clarity, and time to reconnect with myself. i feel like i’ve lost that sense of who i am. i don’t like to say this but perhaps i’m burned out? but that is me thinking out loud. truthfully, i’m simply scared. what if i’m just running away? what if i regret leaving the country while things with my husband feel unfinished? even when he says he will support me no matter what and won’t make the same mistake again, will he leave again in the future? and what if going turns out to be the best thing i could’ve done? even if it’s temporary? right now, even simple things like unpacking my boxes feel exhausting. they’re still stacked in my childhood room and it has been well over a month. i don’t have the energy to make big decisions but i also know staying stuck is draining me and not the option. i’ve been stuck for too long now. and my parents are genuinely not helping nor my partner. i can’t come over to his place cause his dad has shown i am not welcome. he is at my parents place but they’re just on my ass and my mom literally just texted me how i do not understand or whatever. worst part? i do. and i am just simply exhausted from hearing all the nagging and keeping everyone their happiness in consideration. i feel caged. if you’ve been through something similar, i’d love to hear how you navigated it. any insights and advice are truly appreciated! thanks for reading if you’ve got this far!",breakup,1,3787.0,687.0,5.0,0.006868131868131868,0.004120879120879121,0.09752747252747253,5.0,0.0
"solo traveling as a way of healing? i just went through very emotional and painful breakup. i’m devastated and feel so empty. i realized i can’t keep depending on other people and that i need to focus on myself, my needs and my well-being. i keep living in past and don’t know how to escape it. i feel like this (other than therapy) might me the only thing that will save me. i just bought flight tickets to mexico as a volunteer at hostel (from europe). i’m 20, have traveled a lot with my family (so i’m familiar with traveling) and i’ve always had the desire to do such thing. to left everything behind for a month and experience something new and on my own. to heal and possibly start loving myself again and let go of grief. i feel like staying in place will suffocate me. the month will pass anyway. i either do it or not. on the other hand i feel so much fear. of abandonment, of loneliness, of not fitting in, of lonely evenings, long bus rides, dining all alone. of crisis where the only thing i need is to hug someone. has anyone been in the same or similar situation? what did it give you? what have you learnt? about yourself, about world? have you learnt some new perspectives? did it help you heal? how did you feel during and afterwards? thank you ❤️",breakup,1,1265.0,244.0,2.0,0.00819672131147541,-0.004098360655737705,0.09016393442622951,5.0,0.0

"the truth about getting back with an ex the truth is that you can’t change who they are at their core. that no amount of understanding, empathy, love, effort, patience or self-improvement on your part will ever be enough to turn the wrong person into the right one or force someone to show up in a way that they’re either unwilling or incapable of. you can influence, communicate and inspire growth. but, you cannot directly change their emotional capacity, core-values, priorities, attachment style or the depth of their feelings for you. doing that will leave you frustrated, drained and stuck in a dynamic where you’re constantly auditioning for someones love while losing your self-respect and abandoning yourself in the process. at some point, the most powerful form of love is knowing when to accept someone for who they are and from there decide if whether or not they are aligned with who you are, what you’re willing to give, what you need and what you want a relationship to be like. after all, relationships only thrive when both people meet each other as they are, not as projects to fix or potential to unlock. is why things like marrying and committing to someone in the long term is a big, life-changing decision that needs to be made not just with emotion but, also with wisdom, foresight and rationale. because once you made the decision to reconcile with an ex you shouldn’t be with, there’s often no easy way out of this and especially if you end up having kids with the wrong person, you’ll be stuck with and in some ways tied to them forever whether you want that or not. such outcomes can be avoided by learning from other peoples mistakes. by, again, not trying to force a fit when it’s not there and instead only get and stay in relationships with people who are deeply aligned with you and vice versa.",breakup,1,1826.0,335.0,5.0,0.014925373134328358,0.008955223880597015,0.0,0.0,0.0

"light at the end of the tunnel isn’t it crazy, how difficult it is to recover your life after loving someone who isn’t there anymore? it’s like you forgot that you had a whole life before them. that you have struggled and succeeded, and have overcome so many things to make your life so damn wonderful and stable. you meet someone; they break your heart, and it’s like you can’t figure out which way to go anymore. it pushes you off your rocket. it’s like you were standing in a room with them holding your hand; and suddenly, the lights go out and you can’t find your place or position anymore. you just feel lost, blind, and eventually numb. you can’t see. and, their hand is no longer there. you are just alone now. and it feels like you’re dying, in a sense, because they are gone. well, you feel like that part of your life is now dead. and you’re just feeling around the room for some sense of bearing. and some days, all you can do is sit down in the dark and cry. like it feels like you don’t have the mental energy to find the escape door of the room by yourself. like you weren’t even meant to be in this damn room alone. i mean, who does escape rooms by themselves?! wasn’t this supposed to be a team effort? fuck. you just surrender, and you feel stuck. you pray for a light at the end of the tunnel so you can make it out. you just wait and wait for the tiniest gleam of hope and light, that maybe you’ll find your way out. how crazy it is to think, these few months can totally destabilize you in such a profound way. you had a beautiful amazing life before them. they left you, and you need to find the light to leave the room. and when you’re ready, you will.",breakup,1,1675.0,340.0,4.0,0.011764705882352941,0.0,0.0029411764705882353,3.0,0.0

"self accountability required or the guy was actually wrong? i [24f] met this guy [24m] who was a colleague back when we were both 22. we didn’t interact much but i had a little crush on him but i am just the type of girl who wouldn’t do anything abt it unless the guy is interested. after 4 months of relationship he started showing interest and i being very inexperienced got very excited and we both immediately got into a relationship without him proving to me that he actually understands/knows my type and chooses me for it. we didn’t had much bonding we knew each other less and now were gf bf and started love bombing each other. as time passed we planned to move abroad together for studies and settling abroad and also introduce our families. at that time as i knew the guy he seemed fine with good views about women as wives and everything looked fine. we both got a little depressed when we moved abroad and we got very close to each other, he would stay on calls with me all day because we were in different cities and also visited me on weekends. we decided to talk about marriage to our families because it was very lonely abroad but both of our familes thought that we were too young for marriage so may be just an engagement. as time passed, my sister went through a divorce because that guy turned out to be a cheater and it came to her knowledge on a random day after knowing him for two years. we also have history of our father cheating on our mom and our mom telling us about it so it was very traumatic for all of us. i got traumatised and got very careful and discussed with my guy that we got betrayed and how can we know who people really are and one should be careful before marrying because people dont show who they really are and i am traumatised so i got a little against marriage. i still wanted to marry him but i think i kind of projected my trauma on him and said that i want to be careful when getting married and want to take time and test the guy before marrying. i guess i needed him to understand me there but i also didnt think about that it might make him insecure. anyways he used to get triggered with all of it and say that you cant test someone completely before marraige. we both are muslims and i used to feel guilty about getting close with him and now i also wanted to be careful about marrying too early so i very respectfully communicated to the guy that its not good to get so close before marraige so we will try to limit the meetups a bit and be mindful of the religion. he agreed. later on we had arguments about how will we live after marraige, will he call his parents abroad to live with us. my mother was abused by living with my father’s family so i never wanted this. i told him that this is something i dont want to do so what does he thinks about it and how to handle it. there was a lot tension between us for weeks about this and then since i have this tendency to get it fixed i talked to him and he said some words which i accepted as the solution to this problem. later on he started pulling away as i limited his access to me. one of his close relative died so i thought he was disturbed by it. he also started having issues at his job and was supposed to find a new job. i tried to support him in his job search a lot but i was not experienced that it might offend him as he wouldn’t like my advice and it might make him feel weak. he would sometimes take it and sometimes just ignore so i figured he is not liking it and i stopped. we also had some conversation about marraige, pregnancy and i said things like i am very afraid of pregnancy and its too young for marriage. but i never said that i didnt want it with him. anyways he also joked about getting engaged and i considered it as a joke and refused because it felt like he wasnt serious and my family at that time was dealing with the process of my sister’s divorce and i couldnt bring up the topic of my engagement at that time. i didnt even think about it. but then i travelled to my family because my sister was going through a tough time and we all decided to come to her. meanwhile my guy and i had some arguments which i though got resolved but it didn’t got resolved for him becuas he is an avoidant and didnt communicate that he is upset still on that. anyways he started having debates with me about how the life abroad is shit and out home country was better and also about feminism is double standards etc. all of these sensitive topics that will trigger me, i was travelling with family so i didn’t argue much with him and just accepted the fact that he is trying to pin me. we wouldn’t talk for days and just have surface level conversations. i tried to be patient with him but then i lost it and complained to him that why he wouldn’t ask what ive been upto does he nit think about me. during this conversation i got to know that i am not his gf anymore because its against religion and i am not marrying him just testing him so he wont be a bf and wont ask me stuff like if i reached home safely because its not his “responsibility” as he is not my husband yet. i was so shocked i asked him when were you gonna tell me all this because i am still acting as your gf and he said that he couldn’t tell me so i was supposed to figure it out on my own. he said he still wants to marry me but not stay a bf. he said i sent a proposal to your parents now you can reply. then i asked him do you want me to accept you at this emotional availability and he said yes. he didnt give me any solid answer about what are his plans about moving back to our country or anything. i asked him about his views on women and he had typical views that wives are supposed to cook and take care of the home and if she us working then its only for herself so she still has to manage house chores and etc. my world got flipped i couldn’t believe what i was hearing after two years of relationship with the guy. everyone told me to accept the break up and just cut him off. but i still gave him the benefit of doubt i asked him if he was doing this because he was stressed from job search and can he think about it again. i tried to have conversations with him but he was just so rude and inconsiderate of my feelings that i had to stop the begging because i was hurting too much. i left it and just tried to accept the hurt and sit with my feelings alone without crying in front if him. he wouldn’t talk to me because he thought it was not okay in terms of religion but sometimes he would text or call me and we would have an argument that why he is doing what he is doing and then it would not yield a result. he clearly said that he wont make the things as they were but still wants to marry me. i couldn’t make sense of the fact that how he wants to marry me when he would not take my responsibility based on the technicality that he is not my husband yet. how he couldnt respect me to tell me about how i am not his gf anymore and how he is so insensitive to my crying in front of him. i waited for 2.5 months for him to realize, had multiple arguments with him but he was so avoidant and emotionally unavailable that he sent me money on a religious festival pretending that everything is fine. i didnt want his money as he didn’t want to be my bf and was hurting me continuously so i got so hurt that time that he doesn’t realize how serious it is for me and how hurt i am. i blocked him and told him to talk to my parents just as he wanted to handle the marriage related stuff. he got out of control and emailed me that he will text in the community group if i dont reply him. i was shaking worried about what he will say in that group and what people will think of me so i asked my sister to talk to him. they had an argument because the guy was acting unaware of the fact that him texting in the group could affect my reputation. he kept of forcing my sister to ask me to talk to him. i was having my final exams that week and i was so hurt an angry at him and scared of him that he can hurt me i didnt want to talk to him. my sister told him multiple times to wait for a week but he came to my door unannounced and i got so scared that he might hurt me if i opened it. i didnt talk to him. i decided to deal with him on my own and unblocked him to talk to him. he said he realizes that he was emotionally unavailable and wants to get back. i said i am very hurt and i need time. he didnt stop i felt pressured and i couldn’t handle it. it was messy. he asked to meet and talk i said i am just not ready yet. he blocked me but then i had a weak moment and tried to talk to him. he unblocked me too. we talked on and off but then he went back to his family and then he started switching his narrative said. i think it was his family that said all this to him. he also started hitting how two of my sisters arent married and how his sisters are married so he knows how this marriage thing works and we are just handling it wrong. he asked for my pictures one day that i miss u. i got so hurt that he ended the whole freaking relationship with me on this argument and then is doing this unreligious behaviour still. then he also started saying that he has been talking to girls just to know how people think and asked me to implement this “dating advice”. i got hurt that he is already talking to other girls but i didnt say much. later on he started saying that since i have him blocked on socials, he doesn’t know what i am doing on there and he thinks that i am going on different gatherings and making male friends and he wont accept it. i stopped the conversation. he then later on said that its one of his “conditions” for marraige now that he wont accept any friendly interaction with any men of his wife. he wont compromise on his conditions now and i dont have any wife material qualities either but he accepted it before because he was in love and but this male interaction condition is something he wont accept anymore. he is so rude to me and still says that he loves me but says that i manipulate him, gaslight him whenever i try to talk with my emotions with him that he is so rude and is hurting me. i dont know what happened to him, did i turn him into this man because the boy i knew with was so cute and jolly and now he is a different person? was i too selfish with him and now i am getting what i sowed? does he still loves me? all i wanted of him was to be patient with me in commitment and also when he wanted to get back, i was hurt i couldn’t handle my emotions and thoughts. i wanna know what went wrong?",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,4.0,0.0018805829807240243,-0.0023507287259050304,0.10390220968500236,5.0,0.0
"met the love of my life on a gaming app but i messed it up this was like a month long long distance relationship, we're countries apart. but distance never really mattered to us since we were so into each other. i used to mock people that had e-relationships but i went right into one unexpectedly that's how truly amazing as a person she is. she is perfect in every way. she made sure to put forward all her shortcomings(which imo barely counted as such) before going ahead w anything so i can know what i'm getting into. i truly do not believe i can find someone as good as her. we only knew each other for over a month but it was mostly just deep talks which went on for hours at end and it felt like i really knew her. she had past trauma which caused commitment issues due to which she hadn't even been interested in dating anyone for the last few years, but decided to open up to me. but at some point during our relationship i mentioned 2 incidents where i had unintentionally led on someone online who fell in love w me and i had to break their heart cus i did not love them back. this kinda reminded her of her past trauma which involved misleading so this was something she could not get past since it had taken her years to get over that trauma. she tried so hard to get over the misleading aspect and i absolutely love her for it but it always came back to haunt her when she was alone w her thoughts. she even said she could bear any other red flag be it me being homeless/broke or an ex convict but not what i did. she's the strongest person i know and surely she could not risk anything that could ruin her happiness, not after she has been through so much already. so after a few days she decided she can't take it and we broke up. we stopped talking to each other and she got off the gaming app, and a few weeks after that i was drunk and i got to talking to someone on the same app who is a friend. she asked for my snap and i complimented her story which had a selfie. she sent me a couple more pics(normal ones) and i complimented her more and passed a comment on the lines of 'being turned on while looking at her picture' which in hindsight was creepy as hell and i do not even remember saying it until she mentioned it 2 days later. i'm not justifying it by blaming it on the alcohol, maybe i probably would've still flirted w her if it wasn't for that. couple weeks later, my baby came back to the gaming app and i stumbled across her and we got to talking again. she had decided earlier that she will avoid me once she gets back to the app but then she agreed to talk privately just one last time. we got to talking and it was nice just catching up, but then i mentioned that incident of me passing that comment on another girl and it got her so mad. she said she understands we had broken up but she didn't expect me to move on so soon and flirt w others already. she herself couldn't even think of entertaining any men all this while and here i am doing stuff like everything is normal. i tried to justify it initially but then i realised she's making super valid points and how messed up it was on my part to do what i did. and the thing is, i still had thoughts that somehow she could come back to me at some point after thinking things through, but even so, i decided to flirt w someone else during that time. i can't stop beating myself up and my mind is completely messed up rn. i was the first person in years that she decided to trust and i screwed it up before it barely began. she says my actions don't align with my words and in hindsight i have realised how true it is in some cases and have decided it's time for some deep introspection of my behaviour and work on it and make sure i think 100 times before doing anything that can hurt the other person even in the slightest way. i keep doing things that disappoint her, upsetting her more and more every time she takes the time to try and get over my previous actions. i could not sleep for so many hours that night when she actually cried because of what i did, but what good is regret when this could've been easily avoided if my dumbass actually thought about the consequences before even acting on something. she truly deserves someone much better and i actually pray every day that she does, she really is such a pure soul and absolutely deserves every good thing in this world. i call myself an open book but sometimes what she read in my book totally threw her off and rightly so, the things i do sometimes are just so beyond inexplicable that i don't even realise what i'm doin until i've done it and that's something she can't risk getting into. heck, she was even ready to change her religion for me(since mine is strict) and here i was taking it all for granted. i recently went to a different city for some religious meeting where 2 pretty girls seemed to show interest in me but i didn't even care, i was still not over my baby. but when it came to flirt w someone online i barely thought twice before doing it, even though i was drunk, and i feel so damn angry at myself for even trying to justify it to her. goddddd if only i had put myself in her shoes before doing that to her, i could've avoided that incident. the only supposedly good thing to come out of that incident is probably that atleast doing that will make moving on from me much easier for her since i think she could not be any more disappointed in me. this may sound cliche but she truly makes me want to be a better person so as i begin my journey of being a better version of myself, i shall always keep her in my mind. sometimes i try to think of negative things about her so it can help me move on better but trust me when i say i cannot think of a single thing cus she is literally just so perfect and i surely cannot match up to her, but thought that if she could give me one last chance i could show her that i'm willing to do what it takes to be my best self that she deserves, but she's not one to take risks in her personal or professional life which is so frustrating for me but totally understandable considering what she has been through in the past. there are times when i don't think about her much but then so many things in my daily life keep reminding me of her, be it some tv show that mentions the city she lives in or any random cat i see irl or on my insta feed that reminds me of her cat, and my mind just goes spiraling back to thoughts of her. i still love her to death, my gummy bear 🤍 but i've realised like she said that my actions don't align w my words and i'm probably just a sweet talker but now i've promised myself to work on this and be more mindful of my actions and it's consequences on others and make sure i cannot hurt yet another person like i hurt my baby. anyway i'm so sorry this is way too long but i just wanted to vent. thank you to whoever decided to take the time to read

"i keep comparing every girl i see to my ex hey everyone, i (21m) went through a tough breakup two months ago. honestly, it left me heartbroken in a way i’d never experienced before. now when i’m out walking around or just hanging out, i see beautiful women, but none of them seem as beautiful as her. not just physically, but emotionally too. i still find myself comparing them to my ex, not in a shallow way, but in how they *feel*. it’s like no one else makes the same kind of impact - she became this emotional reference point, and it’s been really hard to shake. sometimes i even feel guilty for noticing other women at all, because it just reminds me of how much i still miss her. and that makes me feel like something’s broken inside me - like i’ll never be able to love someone again without constantly measuring it against what i had (or thought i had) with her. has anyone else felt like this? how did you deal with it? how do you move forward when no one feels quite like *her*?",breakup,1,988.0,192.0,7.5,0.041666666666666664,0.010416666666666666,0.09375,3.0,0.0

"we broke up 2 days ago and i want to rant i’m scared my ex will see and read this because he might, but i want to post anyways. hello if you do read this, it’s okay. we [23f and 20m] broke up 2 days ago. i haven’t journaled or anything, i haven’t thought too much about it, i think i’ve avoided thinking because i’m terrified i will break completely. i’ve cried to my parents so much, but i haven’t cried on my own, i’m quite numb. so i’m posting here. we lived together in a city i moved to for a job. we met 2 weeks into me living there and he had just moved there as well. it felt like fate. i only had him there. i didn’t make any friends, i never had any friends to begin with so it wasn’t unexpected. and the job i moved for turned out to be so soul sucking, so i started to hate it. but i was grateful i had him at least. we went on adventures together, even if i had a full-time job, even if he was unemployed and neither of us the most well-off. we made the most out of life and spent so much quality time together. he was my everything, he was my best friend and the one i thought i would spend the rest of my life with. i was always scared i was too much because i was aware i didn’t have anyone else but him, but he made me so happy, he made me fulfilled, so i let myself be selfish. i know i relied on him too much and i wanted to change that in the future because i always wanted to work on myself. i have anxiety, life is hard for me, i always wanted to be better, and i thought he would support me to get there. i supported him when he felt down. when he started slacking on chores i didn’t complain (much) i just did them for him. i understood he had a lot going on and i wanted to support him when he was going through bad things. we had so much fun together. we did everything together. we moved in together after like 3 months of knowing each other because i spent every day sleeping over at his place anyways, so it was already like living together. i knew this was crazy then, but i thought if we work out this is a cute story of how in love we were and how we knew from the very beginning it would be us. he broke up with me because we’re too different. i agree we are, but i think it’s beautiful, i think it’s healthy. we got along great. we never fought, just had small disagreements. i knew there were some things that nagged on him and that he couldn’t get over. he didn’t want me to change for him, he just wished i was different to begin with. i guess he couldn’t accept me for me. he always said he loved me more than i loved him but i always knew that wasn’t true, and now it’s confirmed. he is so different from me, but i understand the way his mind works, i can put myself in his brain and see the world from his perspective. i know he isn’t perfect, i know of his flaws, i can list so many of them, but they never mattered, i didn’t care because my love for him is greater than any petty flaw. i wished he would communicate with me more, that he would show his love more, that he would buy me flowers and that he would take an interest in my hobbies too. i could accept these things because i loved him and he was worth it, i didn’t want to change him, i didn’t care about his flaws. i was so willing to fight for us, i was so willing to communicate and work things out and do anything for him, anything, because that’s what you do when you love someone this much. you don’t give up. you just don’t give up for some imagined future you’re scared of. you don’t know the future, you can’t know this was the right decision. he said he didn’t recognize who he was anymore. he’d started putting in less effort into things, he was getting lazier. i don’t think this was because of me, why would it be because of our relationship? i noticed him changing, i did everything i could, i tried to support him as best as i could. we didn’t have any problems, nothing noticeable, just this slow descent into some kind of sadness. we both had a lot going on. i had a lot weighing on me, and he did too. i think. this was our first challenge in the relationship and i thought we would stick together and make the other stronger. he just escaped. we never faced any challenges, and at the first *hint* of one he just gave up. i know we would have worked out. i know in my very soul we could have had a beautiful life together. i don’t think just one person is your soulmate, so i don’t think he was my one and only, i think i could work with a lot of different people. and i know he was one of them. i know for a fact that the life we could have had together would have been a happy one. and now it’s just gone. everything i thought i knew is just gone. i think he’s scared. i think he is scared of commitment because of his childhood. i think he panics at the thought of being tied down. i think he will always break up with his partners because no one will be the perfect one for him, because no person is perfect, and he will always find something wrong in everyone. no one handles the world exactly the way you do, no one has all the same interests that you do, no one will cope like you do and agree with you on everything. especially since you’re a man and you want a woman, men and women work differently. i think he’s too young to understand the gravity of this decision. i think he will always chase something better. i’m selfish and i don’t think he understands how much i would do for him. i wouldn’t sacrifice myself for him, i wouldn’t forget who i am or become someone else for him, but i would do stuff for him because i know it would make him happy, i would consider anything. i would move to the other side of the planet for him, i would go on his adventures and endulge in his hobbies because it would make me understand him and because it would make us stronger as a couple. i would do things that make me scared if he was just there to help and support me. i still hope he will regret this and i hope it will haunt him. i hope he’ll see this pattern and realize he’s the problem. i have started to accept things more now. but i still think he’s wrong. i still want to be with him and i would still do anything for him. i love him more than i ever loved anything else. i wanted a life with him. i wanted everything with him. and it hurts so much. i am so scared. i’m scared to be alone, i’m scared of how lonely i will be, i’m scared of how depressed i will be. i’m so scared of my future. my whole life will turn upside down now. i hated my job and now i can’t bare to return. i can’t stand the thought of returning to that apartment to see every trace of him gone and to pack up my own stuff. i didn’t have anyone in that city except for him so i have no reason to stay. i’m moving home again to live with my parents. i will be unemployed and unhappy living at home again. it feels like so many steps backwards in my development. it feels like failure. and i can’t stand the thought of never seeing him again, of him being hours away and unreachable. i have no connection to that city and no reason to return, so this is it. he is completely gone forever. it is so harsh and so terrifying. it happened to fast. i can’t accept that this is it.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.009352037408149633,0.014028056112224449,0.1289245156980628,1.0,0.0

"for all the people who got dumped by there ex you’re lucky if you don’t see them anymore trust the fact that you don’t see or even you don’t know nothing about them, would really help you to move on and always remember that you’re lucky. i got stuck with my ex in same environment, already one year passed and still more two years, sometimes you wish that you just can’t see them anymore everything would be more easier but sadly you will be there to discover all the lies all the hurt they cause you. update (long story short): i’ve been in a relationship with her for two years. she dumped me a year ago, but unfortunately, we’re still at the same university even in the same class. the reason we broke up? she said she wanted to “find her life” and claimed she still loved me. i took care of every mess she went through, solving her problems while staying stuck with mine. two years of giving pieces of myself, and getting nothing back. the sad part started after the breakup. she dumped me, but she never wanted to leave me in peace. the most toxic person i’ve ever dated in my life. after the breakup, she told me, “don’t ever talk to me again front of people.” i said, “sure.” but then she started texting and calling me privately, even asking to go out as long as no one could see us. while i got tired of these behaviors, she began playing the victim and blaming the timing. when i accepted the breakup, she started acting like she owned me. and every time she felt like i was moving on, she would come back begging to get back together only to dump me again, just to feel like she had control. she treated everyone else kindly, except for me. in her mind, she owned me. i tried to set boundaries, to talk, to solve things. but for her, it was all just a game. when she felt lonely, she came back. she said awful things about me. she dated other men. she showed care for others. she betrayed me. even at the point where i lost my mind and said, “f*** all of this, i don’t want to see your f***ing face again,” she admitted that she was toxic and confessed all the bad things she did to me. she said, “sorry for hurting you so bad.” but the next morning? she came back and said, “don’t call me again. i won’t talk to you anymore.” that’s when i gave her a promise that she would never hear from me again. not for her, but for me. she had me hooked for seven months. but then i stopped everything and just focused on myself. in the last two weeks, she tried to talk to me not once again in front of people calling my name pretending the kindness but she only heard my silence and that silence is forever. so i found out that the best thing i can do it’s just ignoreeeeeee with no reaction. so sometimes, i just wish i hadn’t met here at the first time.",breakup,1,2758.0,549.0,7.5,0.02185792349726776,-0.0018214936247723133,0.08378870673952642,2.0,0.0

"omg i cracked it!!! this is the secret to getting over them instantly!! (it works👏🏻👏🏻) i’ve cracked it. seriously. after years of heartbreak, therapy, crying over people who gave less than zero shits about me, i’ve finally figured out the secret trick to getting over someone instantly. you ready? are you sure? really?? ok … here goes … “become completely repulsed by anyone who treats you badly.” not just annoyed. not just hurt. not just disappointed. repulsed.!!!! i’m talking stomach-turning, eye-rolling, immediate switch-off energy when someone doesn’t do right by you. whether it’s a partner, a friend, your boss, your family ~ if they can’t treat you with basic decency and respect, that’s your sign to mentally bin them. because here’s the truth: we’ve been conditioned to tolerate poor behaviour. to over-explain ourselves. to make excuses for people’s lack of effort or kindness. to tell ourselves they’re “just going through something” or “don’t know how to love properly.” screw that. the second you flip the switch from “why don’t they love me?” to “why the hell am i trying to get love from someone who treats me like this?” ~ that’s the moment you win. that’s the moment you get your power back. that’s when the obsession dies. want proof? i’ll give you a story … there was this guy i was hung up on for months. we weren’t even officially together, but the way i thought about him ~ you’d think i was mourning a soulmate. he breadcrumbed me. ghosted me then came back with a “sorry i’ve just been busy.” he never made solid plans, never showed up emotionally, and made me feel like i had to earn the bare minimum. and i ate it up. i kept telling myself he was “damaged” and that if i just loved him harder, he’d finally see i was the one. one night i was crying into my pillow over him (again), and something in me just snapped. i suddenly saw it clearly: i was obsessing over someone who didn’t deserve the steam of my piss. i reread all his messages. the flakiness. the one-word replies. the way he made me feel like a side dish in his life. instead of feeling sad, i felt sick. this man wasn’t mysterious. he wasn’t special. he wasn’t broken. he was just a lazy, emotionally unavailable man who was never going to choose me ~ not properly. not fully. and i had been giving my soul to that. wasting months of my life waiting for crumbs when i deserved the whole cake. once i let myself get repulsed instead of heartbroken, the spell broke. completely. like flipping a switch. i went from crying over him to laughing at the fact i ever wanted him. i could’ve written a novel on the fantasies i built in my head about someone who gave me nothing to work with. there’s a book i picked up around that time called [rejection breeds obsession]( and holy shit ~ it explained everything. it laid it out so clearly. i wasn’t in love. i was addicted to the feeling of rejection. i was chasing validation from someone who didn’t have the capacity to give it, because deep down i thought i needed them to prove i was worthy. spoiler: i don’t. you don’t. none of us do. that magical book helped me realise i was in a twisted emotional loop, craving a hit of approval from someone who never actually saw me. once i saw it for what it was ~ that they weren’t special, i had just made them special ~ i snapped out of it. so here it is again, for the people in the back: the fastest way to get over someone? start being disgusted by people who treat you like shit. stop being flattered by crumbs. start being offended. they are not rare. they are not your twin flame. they are just someone who couldn’t do the bare minimum, and you’ve been wearing heartbreak goggles and calling it love. never again.",breakup,1,3702.0,687.0,5.0,0.007112375533428165,0.005689900426742532,0.08392603129445235,5.0,0.0
"loving from afar my ex and i broke up around five months ago after we broke each other's boundaries and were arguing on and off for a few weeks leading up to it. after two months no contact, i messaged her and we met up to try and iron things out and see if there's anything left in the tank. we both expressed how much we love each other and how we want to be together til the very end. we expressed how sorry we were for the hurt we caused and that we were stupid for even going no contact in the first place. it seemed like we were on the path toward rebuilding, but a few days later i met up with her and we both had a feeling that we were going to try and restart things. because of that she wanted to be honest with me, and she told me that she started talking to someone about a week or so prior to me breaking no contact. they never went on date or anything, all they did was talk on the phone once or twice (small talk and icebreakers nothing crazy) and text each other from time to time. she claimed she had no feelings for him and felt that she just needed to snap out the depression of missing me by venturing out. looking back at it now she did absolutely nothing wrong, all she was trying to do was move on because she thought that i was over her since i was the one who initiated no contact. unfortunately in that moment when she told me about it i broke down and felt betrayed because i just couldn't imagine how someone could call me the love of their life but then proceed to talk to another person less than two months post break up. my break down caused everything to fall apart again and we spent hours crying in each others arms wishing none of this ever happened. the next day she made the judgment call of ending things for good. she told me how much she loves me and how deep down she does believe we were meant to be together, but she felt the relationship was taking too much of a toll on our mental well beings and that continuing with it would make the relationship toxic. she didn't want us to drag each other down and end up resenting down the line, so she wanted to end it while there was still love. i didn't fight it because her previous ex always pressured her into staying no matter how many times she tried ending things, and i didn't want her to feel stuck again and relive those traumas. we both ended it with our last words being i love you. it's been three months since that and i mourn this relationship just as much as i did at the start of the year. not an hour goes by where i don't think about her. i've tried a handful of things. i've been going to therapy twice a week for the last four months, going to the gym, learning the guitar and piano, traveling, drawing, journaling, and distracting myself with my friends. no matter how hard i try, i find myself thinking about her and falling into a depression. nothing i do makes me feel remotely as good or happy than when i was with her. she truly was the missing piece to my puzzle. i never felt more loved, i never felt more comfort, i never slept so well, and i never felt more motivated. i'd look into her eyes and see the most beautiful soul ever. i saw my future wife, my best friend, and my biggest supporter and now all i can do is love from afar. i've found myself constantly getting thrown into loops that make this process of moving on that much more difficult. about a month and a half ago one of my coworkers showed me an instagram story of my ex writing about how much she misses me. then about two weeks ago, one of my friends posted my grad photos on his instagram story and she liked the story. my friend asked her why she liked it and she told him that she felt extremely happy for me and proud of all the work i put in, but she also reassured him that we are broken up for good and asked him not to tell me that she liked his story because she didn't want me overthinking things (which obvs he didn't). although it hurts, i do feel extremely grateful that she's happy and proud of me because without her support i wouldn't have been able to get through college, and her support will always mean the world to me. it doesn't make me angry that she doesn't want me to know, in fact i don't feel much anger about anything. when i look back at what lead to us breaking up five months ago i don't hold that same anger anymore, instead i've been learning to understand our actions, and i find myself wishing things turned out differently. there's no doubt in my mind that my love for her is true. i've been wanting to ask her to get lunch some time, not even to get on my knees and beg for her to come back, but to just see her again and see how she is doing. i've been restraining myself from asking because i don't want to bother her and cause any distress. i've also restrained because i'm not sure if i can separate the emotion i feel for her if we were to talk. my heart tells me i should, my head says don't and i'm sure everyone will agree with my head. all i've heard over the last five months is that time heals and the more people say it the more it frustrates me because time has not been on my side and it feels like it never will. i wish love wasn't so complicated, i wish love was enough, and i wish i didn't have to love from afar.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.02131782945736434,0.014534883720930232,0.09593023255813954,0.0,0.0

"breakup with an female avoidant met a girl 29f and im 28m and we were going out for four months which isnt the longest period of time. everything from the get go was perfect or so i thought , she had this hot and cold behaviour which was also self sabotaging. she would always reschedule dates based on her mood and a few times would self sabotage herself early on. from what i understand by the end of our relationship is that she would try come up with any reason to leave at certain points in our relationship but her parents/friends would help her get past her self sabotaging behaviours so it continued. keep in mind throughout most of our dating she would act like she was head over heels in love with me. also for context she had issues with her father growing up , and also her parents split up for a certain period of time which im assuming is the causes of her avoidant behaviours. the craziest part for me is we had a weekend getaway planned , the day before the weekend getaway she had told me she just cried because i was the best thing to ever happen in her life and was talking about buying a house in the future. que 24-48 hours we are on the rocks and the vibe has completely changed. she started picking my life apart and started to tear me down and gaslight me in very subtle ways. then the conversation turned into not feeling a spark/ romantic connection and i was the reason to blame for various reasons like that "" i had a wall up"" or im too reserved. im no perfect person but i always take feed back and try to improve myself as a person. anyway no answer or response that i gave was good enough for her , she had basically moved on in her mind and was looking for an escape. i did have gut feelings at certain points in the relationship that some things werent normal , but i looked past it because she checked alot of boxes and would take accountability ( but she would not change her behaviour in hindsight) throughout everything i held myself composed and calm and collected for the most part. i probably could have called her out more at certain points but i didnt. it ended over text then and i just told her best of luck and didnt beg or cry. now its been a week of no contact. from what i understand by reading other reddits threads. avoidant people tend to comeback alot ? or they text just to check in. so i would be interested to see if she does. she obviously has alot of trauma causing her behavoiurs which i could see she was working on but shes not there yet. im not sure i would take her back based on everything that has happend and taking advice from other people. i wont lie im very curious if she is going to reach out to me again. this was my first experience with a girl like this and while it was one of the best experiences for me , alot of the behaviours i experienced arent normal in a relationship that should be easy and fun.",breakup,1,2877.0,545.0,7.0,0.012844036697247707,0.0,0.062385321100917435,1.0,0.0

"she ghosted, lied, manipulated, apologized — and even then, i can’t move on. why? 6 months ago, i got ghosted by someone i was deeply emotionally attached to. she manipulated me by saying things like, “i have to leave you because of my strict family,” but later i realized that was mostly an excuse. i begged her for proper closure, told her ghosting was childish — but instead of being honest, she flipped it and made it about me not trusting her. classic gaslighting. she moved on quickly. meanwhile, i was stuck in the dark, confused and shattered. to make things worse, she spread false narratives to her friends — portraying me as the villain. that added a deep layer of pain. then, 5 months later, she saw a post of mine on linkedin and suddenly came back. apologized tearfully. begged for forgiveness. fully admitted to everything — the manipulation, the emotional damage, the lies. she even started people-pleasing and doing “damage control” behavior post-apology. i’ll be honest — it felt like real closure. but here’s the confusing part… 3 days after the apology, i still couldn’t hold it in — i called her again and bashed her emotionally. she didn’t resist, she just took it. she again accepted all blame. said she was sorry. and honestly — i believed her. so now i’ve gotten: • ghosted ✅ • lied to ✅ • gaslit ✅ • villainized ✅ • apologized to ✅ • given closure ✅ • even got to confront her properly ✅ and still… i can’t move on. i don’t want her back. i know she’s not emotionally healthy. i don’t trust her at all. but some part of me keeps holding on to the story, the injustice, the emotional loop, or the fantasy of how it “should have gone differently.” why do i still feel stuck, even after getting everything i thought i needed? how do you move on when your brain keeps replaying a story that’s already over? any real advice or personal experiences would help. i’m genuinely trying to heal and let go.",breakup,1,1921.0,338.0,1.0,0.0029585798816568047,0.0,0.07692307692307693,3.0,0.0

"confused, i didn’t see it coming - blindsided with a familial drama! **background** my ex and i were just in our 30s. i just got blindsided and found myself in a familial drama! long story short, my ex's mum was very controlling. she used to track us while we were dating! now it was over - they both had a big fight to work it out. and yet her mum just wouldn't let go and kept asking our whereabouts. **cause of the drama** her mum's questions had my pressure building up. i decided to give it a shot by venting with my ex. we tried to talk, but it ended up with a fight. she reassured me that these questions had nothing to do with me, and no one had held any grudges. but i felt like my concerns didn't just come out of the blue. things began to heat up. i was told to put my thoughts aside, or else i would let her and her family down. my ex became very anxious and said this needed to be done asap. a day later she brought up our past issues & conflicts years ago (those who let her family down in particular, so yep there were grudges). unaware of most of them, some being too trivial, i was confused - not knowing that she had these hidden emotions. **triggering points** i suggested lining up a meeting with her family to resolve these past issues & conflicts by being a more supportive partner. to my surprise, my ex insisted that it was up to her mum to decide whether to meet me or not. she warned me not to be childish and rebellious. i thought this could ease our concerns. but then she was in distress. i was told not to act against her mum's will. my family was very supportive of my ex, hoping that we could walk her through all the family tantrums and help her find solace. but she said it was better for me not to talk about her family dynamics in front of my parents. i was left stranded, and thought this was manipulative. for us this was care, not burden. **ticking bomb** she had an emotional breakdown. i said we'd better disconnect from each other a bit, giving some space & time to recover. she said she was no longer interested, and that i had become the emotional trigger. she declared to break up immediately, and i didn't see it coming. it became obvious that she wanted to fix things with her family first. granted, her mum had been straining our relationship, hence the chat (and the fight). what shocked me the most was that there was lots of blame-shifting at the end of our fight. wow, what i heard at the end was i was the one who triggered her anxiety for long ... **aftermath** i was blindsided and got ghosted. we went straight into no contact. how on earth would one run away from problems when relationships got hard? i knew dealing with her parents was rough. but i didn’t mean to quit. my partner did, ironically. **reflection** began reaching out to friends for help and meditation. talked to social workers and they said these were probably signs of relapse. it’s just sad to see how your partner ended up blaming everything you did for the end of the relationship. i know mentally she’s struggling, and i wish i could stay & help. yet, i just couldn’t and felt sorry for her. i’m writing this story to remind all how lovebirds could turn into strangers, because of the family dynamics. **moral of the story** • did this chat have to turn into a fight? probably not. • could i have said/done something better to salvage the relationship? yes. but the blindsiding and all the blame-shifting are so unnecessary. family and mental health issues could be ticking bombs. it’s just a matter of time.",breakup,1,3538.0,661.0,7.5,0.01664145234493192,0.0030257186081694403,0.08623298033282904,3.0,0.0

"how can someone change so quickly? i [19f] only dated my ex [20m] for 3 months, but we were really close friends before that and i think that’s what i’m grieving more than the relationship itself. (yes i should have left earlier before i get those comments idk why i stayed it was my first relationship) he seemed perfect for me on paper and i rlly liked him which is rare for me my type, same goals, same interests, not a frat guy, very sweet a shy loverboy . he noticed i love california (where he’s from) invited me to roadtrip back at the end of school and even offered to help pay for my flight back so we he would tell my roommate he was nervous around me and actually liked me unlike his ex or other girls and do typical things you do when u crush on someone. we started dating and he said things like “i could marry you,” “i want my kids to have your eyes,” and “you bring me peace.” he told his mom about me two days in, even though she didn’t know about his ex. but things started to unravel. he blamed his lack of effort on a girl from years ago who hurt him when he tried, and i regret excusing it. he’s christian and i’m not, and while he said it didn’t matter, he flipped after i questioned parts of the bible suddenly saying he couldn’t marry me ever anymore and that was strike one?? i told him to rethink things, and he said, “no, i want you. christian girls aren’t fun anyway.” and would say don’t breakup with me i’ll be sad and don’t love bomb me? over time, he got colder and meaner. he said awful things called me pathetic for falling off a bike, said i was like a dog on a leash, got annoyed at me for crying when we were about to go long distance, and told me he couldn’t hurt a christian girl when i asked why he doesn’t go date one instead. got annoyed i wouldn’t give him head he said “it would have sucked anyways”, even though he’d said he wanted to wait until marriage for anything just weeks earlier. but then would switch up the next day saying i mean so much to him, he can’t sleep without me , taking to me brings him so much peace , i’m such an amazing girlfriend and this pattern kept going. during a roadtrip to california, the worst came out. he was distant, didn’t want to take me anywhere, and broke up with me out of nowhere i freaked out and said some things like i need you, pls don’t do this it will ruin my summer (i took all this back and apologized) then backtracked and said we could try for another month. he later cried in my arms about being a bad boyfriend, but the next day he got annoyed at me for crying and said if i did it again, he wouldn’t take me to the airport (despite letting me cry in his arms 2 weeks ago saying he cares about me) he went cold again, he saw me crying and just turned over and went to bed again i was crying cus it was our last night together and he was cold and wouldn’t accept my apology for my anxious reassurance seeking earlier. after i got home, i gave him space, but when i did reach out, he was annoyed. i asked to visit and he said he needed space all summer. when i asked where he stood emotionally, he officially broke up with me, saying “i don’t like you enough,” “i’m too mean to you,” “i can’t marry you,” and “i need to be alone and closer to god” “and he always feels like the bad guy and i can’t function without him” (not true i’m very self sufficient) despite making future plans with me just days before. the last week in california he did say things like closeness scares me , i feel trapped avodiant 101 so i tired to learn about it and give him space and told him working on my anxious attachment and apologized for anything i could have done wrong. but it still ended a week later. he also - could only handle communication long distance over snapchat streaks and fortnite - indecisive about everything in his life - had no friends because everyone was mean apparently - was cold and making jokes while breaking up with me and then talked to me the next day and was like “girl your still sad about that?” it was short but genuinely such a mindfuck we agreed to stay friends but i basically got cut off from his life and he seems fine now i wasn’t perfect i was anxious but i was doing what i could to change for him and be better i think the worst i would do was cry or be sad and when he asked why i would say him and other things (which was true) , but he also admitted i was perfect for him so who knows. it rlly hurts because he dated me for my kind loving heart , knew i was a hopeless romantic, knew i never dated anyone becasue of my trust issues and still did this.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.009825327510917031,-0.006550218340611353,0.10807860262008734,5.0,0.0

"her blue, my sky"" – a love story in a small town tucked within the deserts of rajasthan, there lived a boy named neer—a dreamer, a lover, a little reckless, and endlessly real. it was in class 11 that his world quietly changed. he saw her. reen—dusky, beautiful, and impossibly perfect. she wasn’t just another girl in the class. she was the moment he started believing in something deeper. she wore blue one day, and he swore the sky borrowed its colour from her. at first, he just stole glances. but fate wasn’t interested in silence. after two months of shared space and passing smiles, they started talking—about everything and nothing. neer fell in love with the way her voice danced, the way her laugh filled the air like it belonged there. reen was playful, mischievous, making games out of numbers, gifts out of guesses. she was the kind of girl you didn’t just love—you felt her. and then… she proposed. his heart pounded so loud he thought the whole world could hear it. but the answer was already in his eyes: “i love you too.” they began dating—two hearts beating faster with each day. in class 12, even though they were in different sections, neer made sure he was near her every period. passion took its place beside affection. they explored love emotionally and physically, unafraid of judgment, unbothered by gossip. in their small town, everyone knew their story, because neer didn’t hide it. he wasn’t afraid to kiss her on the road, or whisper “i love you” in front of the world. she was his, and he was proud. but school life ended, and so did the comfort of routine. dreams pulled them in different directions. she got selected for veterinary sciences, while he started preparing for neet. but love isn't logical—it’s emotional. after 2–3 months of coaching, the ache of distance grew unbearable. he dropped neet and came back home, unable to fight the emptiness her absence caused. they were together again. but the road ahead wasn’t smooth. she moved forward in her journey. he started preparing for government exams, and in time, got selected for the indian air force. it was a dream come true. but love doesn’t follow resumes or ranks. one night, she looked at him and said, “don’t go. i can’t live without you.” so, he didn’t. with the confidence of a boy who had already given his everything for love, neer left the air force, believing he could build a life near her—because what’s the point of flying high if the one you love is not waiting when you land?",breakup,1,2484.0,453.0,1.0,0.002207505518763797,0.024282560706401765,0.008830022075055188,1.0,0.0
"she left me when i was at my lowest. it still hurts, but i’m rebuilding we didn’t meet in a bar or a park or through friends at a party. we met through a message. a message i didn’t expect, from someone i didn’t know. her roommate had mentioned me—said i was part of the international student community, that i spoke french. so she reached out. i didn’t understand at first what she wanted. she was cautious, maybe shy. it took time for her to explain. for a second, i even wondered if the account was fake. but something told me to keep the conversation going. and i said yes. yes to helping her practice french. yes to something small that would become much more. the first time i saw her was in early october. the air was cool. she wore a look of quiet curiosity, with soft eyes that seemed to carry more than she ever said. i remember walking away from that first meeting thinking, *she’s different.* not dramatic. not loud. just… different. and we kept talking. she’d ask me how to say things in french. i’d correct her with a smile. we started walking together. then texting more. and then it grew into something more than i realized, until it became everything. i still remember the moment i knew i was falling for her. it was our first kiss. early december. i had bought flowers, met her at the train station, and there was this quiet warmth between us. i wasn’t nervous anymore. i felt something settle inside me. like i had found a place to land. she told me she loved bento cakes, so i planned to surprise her with one for her birthday. she once said that her last birthday was lonely—she even showed me a photo of her with a very small cake, alone, that no one did anything special for her. i promised myself i would change that. that this year, she’d feel celebrated. that she’d remember it as the birthday someone finally made her feel seen. we shared so many small things that became big memories. we cooked together—spicy noodles, warm soup, her favorite breakfast. we even made a list of dishes we wanted to try. that list stayed unfinished, like most things between us. we watched series together. i still haven’t finished the shows, and i probably never will. those were *our* moments, *our* shows. and the movie she told me to watch? it’s still sitting in my folder, untouched. it hurts too much to watch it now. i was saving it so we could talk about it after. now, there’s no after. she had a cat—a quiet, fluffy presence in her life. she sent me photos constantly. him on the windowsill. hiding under a blanket. i grew fond of that cat, not just because of him, but because of what he meant to her. he was a part of the home she carried with her. we even talked about going places together—exploring, traveling, trying things we hadn’t done before. simple things. beautiful things. there was a quiet poetry in those ideas, like we were sketching out the early drafts of a shared future. we once even talked about the places we wanted to live in. she had a very precise place in mind, in a big city to the north. she showed me the exact streets she dreamed of living in. we put a map marker there, and i promised her i would buy a home for us there someday. i finally had a goal, something to work toward. i never felt more motivated, more happy to work toward something. but then, slowly, i started to feel her slipping away. her answers became shorter. she always looked a bit bored. her texts felt like she was forcing herself to write to me. she got mad over small things that didn’t matter before. i wasn’t perfect, of course—i have my flaws—but i did my best and worked to fix them. she was always the priority. at first, i thought it was just stress. exams. fatigue. life. i didn’t want to believe she was changing her mind. i tried to be patient. i didn’t want to pressure her. i believed that love meant giving space. she deflected my questions each time. i tried multiple times to open her shell, but she didn’t want to talk. like she didn’t want the problems to be solved. she told me i wasn’t expressive enough. that i was too closed. so i tried. i opened up. i told her about my struggles. about what it’s like to be a foreigner, alone, building a life from scratch. i made myself vulnerable. i told her what i thought when she did things i didn’t like. i started to feel comfortable. she was the kind to be open about her wants and needs, so i thought maybe she expected the same from me. but now that i think about it, she never talked about what she *really* thought. and then came the message. she told me it was over. that she had *“lost her feelings.”* that it wasn’t my fault. that she was open to talk, but to please not try to convince her to change her mind. that i was an amazing boyfriend, that me opening up to her wasn’t the problem—i didn’t even mention that, which makes me think maybe it *was* about that. she also added something about giving me back the money for an expensive gift for her birthday, one she found by mistake. like our relationship was a transaction. like money was important for me in that moment. and the worst part? it happened a week before her birthday. a week before the cake. the plan. the small hope i carried that maybe this year, i could give her something beautiful. even though i might not have made the best chocies before, i knew that i shouldn't beg for the relationship back or ask her to rethink her decision, i knew a relationship where only one person wants to be in is not something i wanted. about the night she wrote the message: she was coming back to town on a train that night. i was supposed to meet her at 4 a.m. to walk her home—i always did, because i was afraid something would happen to her. but this time, she didn’t want me there. instead, i packed a bag with everything she’d ever given me: the books, the half-empty bottle of perfume, the notes she’d scribbled during lectures. the birthday gift. i waited outside the train station in the dark, my hands shaking. it was snowing. when she arrived, i handed it to her without a word. i didn’t want these ghosts in my room anymore. she looked at me. the only words i could say were, *""why… exactly like your ex did to you?""* she answered that it was different. i didn’t have the strength to argue, so i left. she looked tired. not sad. just tired. *“we can talk tomorrow if you have questions,”* she texted later. like she was scheduling a dentist appointment. the next day, i cried in front of her. i’m not proud of it. but i won’t pretend it didn’t happen. i couldn’t hide the pain. she looked at me and said, *“i’m sad too.”* but her face was calm. she didn’t cry. she didn’t flinch. i asked why. she gave me the same answer. she said she was sorry, but we could stay friends. i said not for now. but through it all, she was so calm. like she was a robot. like it was something annoying she just had to do. the closeness, all the moments—it didn’t mean anything. and that’s when it really broke me. she had never told her friends i was her boyfriend. said we’d wait. i agreed, even though it made me feel invisible. she still had a photo of her ex and her on her page—the one that dumped her by saying *“i lost feelings”* and left without a word. i told her it bothered me. she promised to delete it later, but she didn’t want to for now. she never did. she said it didn’t mean anything. but it meant something to me. on new year’s eve, she went to a party. two of her exes were there. none of her friends knew about me. one guy asked her out. and she didn’t say, *“i have a boyfriend.”* she just told me after—casually, like it didn’t matter. it *should’ve* mattered. but i didn’t say anything. i stayed quiet. i thought love meant understanding. but love also means respect. and i should’ve stood up for myself. by the time i did, it was too late. she had already decided to leave. one more important thing: **the camera and the photos we never saw** once, i bought her one of those old-fashioned cameras—the kind where you take 30-something photos and have to develop them to see what you’ve captured. she loved the idea of it. the waiting. the surprise. we took pictures together. silly ones. tired ones. a few where she’s looking at me in a way that, at the time, made me think she saw a future too. but we never developed them. she took the camera with her when she left. i wonder now what those photos would’ve shown. were there moments she loved but forgot? did she ever look at them after? or were they just another unfinished thing—like the movie, like the birthday cake, like us? **the mistake: a few months later** i lasted one month without reaching out. then i reached out about my promise to teach her french. i don’t know what i wanted—maybe to see her. i didn’t expect anything. i’m not a big believer in friendship after love, so i probably expected closure. i said we should meet in march or april. she said april because the weather would be better—even though inside, i knew we started hanging out in october when the weather was worse, so this was probably a pretext. but i was happy with it. in the last week of april, i wrote to her. i told her i was disappointed in her. (i knew this was her last year and she would leave in may, so she planned on leaving without ever honoring her words anyways or texting about that ) but i probably shouldn’t have. she said she never promised—it’s true, she just said the idea fit her, but still, she knew what it meant. probably. i was upset, so i didn’t write for a while. but after some time, i wrote to make peace. i felt like i didn’t need to have those bad feelings in me anymore, we even joked a little, even if it felt weird. one month or a few weeks later, an idea started floating in my head: *was it really “lost feelings,” or was she just trying to soften the blow?* i thought she wouldn’t mind telling me after so long. but i misread the situation. i asked. her reply was like a knife. she got very upset she said writing her was wrong that it wasn't normal, she probably felt cornered like i was accusing her, that wasn't my goal, i just wanted closure in some way, it didn't help that my message was very long i can understand her being annoyed, i always write like that when i have something deep to say. but it was probably a chore for her, she even said that, the tone and aggressiveness didn't affect me but what did was the last phrase. *“i let you go,”* she said. *“so please let me go.”* i was gonna answer "" off course! you left me without giving me any chance but then i realized."" she was probably right, it's been long she didn't have any obligation towards me, and i had been too focused on all of this probably, so i just apologized and and told her goodbye for good, i realized then: closure wasn’t something she could give me. it was something i’d have to claw out of myself. i work every day to become the man i swore i’d be. for myself. for the future. for the life i want to build. but no matter how hard i work, there are moments where the sadness comes back. sometimes i remember. sometimes i feel stuck. sometimes i wonder if i’ll ever be able to trust someone again. not because of who she is, but because of what i became after. still, i keep going. because i know that next time, i’ll be smarter. i won’t give my heart too quickly. i won’t ignore the signs. i’ll speak up when something hurts. i won’t allow myself to be a secret. and i have my new goal. i *will* buy that house in that part of town she talked about—not for her, but for me. i will realize all the dreams we had together, but for *me.* i have a new goal, and she just chose not to be part of the equation. if she ever reads this—and i doubt she will—i don’t write it for pity. i write it to remember. to mark the moment i changed. to remind myself of who i was, and who i’m becoming. if someone out there is reading this and going through something similar—i promise you, the pain fades. slowly. but it fades. and in its place, something stronger grows. i don’t know if she’ll ever look back. if she’ll ever realize what she walked away from. maybe she’s already found someone else. someone with more money. more time. more status. but i know this: i gave her everything i had. even when i had almost nothing. and now i’m building something better—not to win her back, but to prove to myself that i didn’t break. that i’m still standing. this chapter ends here. the next one is already being written. — m - sorry if the story is a little mess i wrote as i went",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.006916192026037429,0.0024410089503661514,0.10333604556550041,5.0,0.0
"just broke up with her a week ago..... ‎i honestly don’t even know where to start. i lose the love of my life a week ago. she was the first woman i truly loved more than anything in this world and also the first girl i ever dated seriously. ‎throughout our relationship, we went through a lot. there were three breakups, and one major fallout that nearly tore us apart. but somehow, we always found our way back to each other. no matter what happened, we both returned like we couldn’t stay away for long. ‎but now... it’s different. she's really gone. blocked me. disappeared like i never existed. and i don’t know how to process this pain. it's my first time going through something like this, and the weight of the regret is unbearable. ‎she loved me. she trusted me. she cared for me in ways no one ever had. and now, it’s like i’m a stranger to her just a memory she erased. ‎everything feels so cold now. my phone doesn’t ring. no notifications. i’ve cut everyone off, deleted all my social media, hoping i could use this silence to find myself again... to maybe come back stronger. but the truth is, i feel lost. ‎the nights are the worst. trying to fall asleep feels like torture. every time i close my eyes, all i see is her face—those beautiful eyes that once looked at me with so much love. her voice echoes in my head like a loop i can’t escape. ‎i cry sometimes. and honestly, crying is the only thing that helps a little, like it's the only proof that i can still feel something. but even then, i’m not sure if i’m healing or just sinking deeper. ‎she was everything i ever wanted. my heart, my peace, my reason. now that she’s gone, i feel like i’ve lost the purpose of my life. ‎if anyone’s been through this, or has something—anything—that could help, please… i could really use it right now. i just want to know how to survive this pain, because right now, i don’t see the light.",breakup,1,1897.0,372.0,4.0,0.010752688172043012,0.002688172043010753,0.12096774193548387,0.0,0.0
"feel like a sad zombie and need help so i got broken up with a month ago and i just can't. literally every single thought is him, or something he said or something we did and it's driving me insane. every goddamn thought. everything is just tainted with his memory. basically for the last 30 or so days all i am doing is waking up and just watching shows and i don't even wanna watch anything, i just do it so that i can't think about him. i don't feel anything when watching the shows it's just to keep my brain quite for a while. i am actually going insane. and i just want it to stop, i don't feel human anymore. i just wake up and try to occupy my brain with as much garbage as i can, to not think about him. why does this hurt so much? i have been through worse, i have been through so much worse than someone just changing their role in my life. i am currently no contact, but if i let him ik he will be in my life (as a friend) forever. i have been through worse, i just don't know why i am basically paralyzed. i got dropped out of two internships cause i just wasn't able to do anywork. and they were really important, and i just fucked it up. i troubled, am still troubling my mom a lot. i just can't. what's worse is any friend that i break this news to just blows it over, that he will come back. and i mean i don't blame them, i broke up with him once cause i thought he deserved better, and that i couldn't be better...and he broke up with me cause he wanted to and cause he doesn't love me. huge difference .so i mean he's not ever coming back, and i know it very well. just why is there a dumb f*cking sliver of hope that he will? i know for a fact he won't yet some tiny part of me thinks he will and i just hate for that hope to be there cause it's just tiring. i don't wanna hope for something that isn't going to happen. it's so foolish, it's like waiting for pigs to fly just so dumb. i can't with myself and what sucks the most is i knew from the very beginning that this was going to happen. i knew it. i know i am not necessarily a joy to date so i kept putting him off, i told me every single day why we shouldn't date. heck he even experienced how it's gonna be like dating me before we actually dated. i only agreed to date him cause he said "" not dating you hurts more than dating you"". and uk what i still would have gotten it if he broke up after that, i still would have. the only reason i am so frustrated is he broke up when i was trying the hardest to be better (i was trying earlier too but not hard enough just more passively). i had decided, set out a plan with checks and points to be a better person, to be someone who deserves to date him. i didn't want someone else to be that ""better"". and it wasn't just all talk. i spent 3 f*cking hours trying to make a hello kitty half presentable. i am not artistic at all, i couldn't draw a straight line even if the world depended on it. i had other people who were more than willing to help me. but i wanted to show him that i love him, be it 3 grueling hours of pure frustration to make an okayish card... and he just broke up. when i was putting in more effort he just ended it. and it hurts, i could be the perfect person but i can't force him to love me,now can i? please don't give me the ""other fishes in the sea"" reasoning. ik there are. i don't particularly believe in soulmates. my philosophy is that you can pick anyone you want and love them and make a soulmate outta them. but i picked him, i picked him to be my forever and i was really trying, pulling in all the stops and he just didn't ...pick me. i guess arranged marriages are right afterall? that way it becomes more difficult for the other person to unpick you. i have kinda lost faith in love. what even is the point? you love too much, you lose. you love too little, there's no one left to love anymore. i need a distraction, my screen time is freaking 12 hours. i try to sleep for the other 10 and 2 is just miscellaneous ig. sleeping is another escape but even it sucks. him and his friends come in my dreams without fail, every goddamn day. i just can't deal with it. every single dream. and the going-to-sleep part is even worse, cause it's just me left alone with my thoughts, thoughts of him. pure torture. and i don't have a ton of friends, everyone is at home for the vacation. i don't have much to do around my hometown either. not a very happening city unless you have a lot of money at your disposal. i can't go to professionals for help either, dating isn't something that's very accepted among the elders yet where i am from. i am just really really tired of being a mindless zombie. i wake up, try to forget the new dream about him where everything is normal and rainbows and sunshine, and force myself to watch a something that doesn't have anything loving in it, bathe while crying, eat while watching something, continue watching, eat again, and then sleep. that's all i have been able to do. eating is another thing i can't particularly do well either, i was already underweight to begin with but i had some fat. it's just all gone and my clothes don't fit me anymore and i know it's very unhealthy but no matter how hard i try i just can't get myself to eat more than a couple of bites without feeling nauseous. another physical ache has been chest pains. it started after the breakup, whenever a thought about him stings my chest starts aching and it takes 2-3 hours to slowly die. and then another thought and it's back again within a couple of minutes. i can't get myself to enjoy any hobbies or work. it's just leaves room for me to have thoughts. i don't draw or paint. i can't listen to music cause most of them are about love or heartbreak or have things that remind me of him. playing games that i like or reading books still just leaves so must space. i can't survive the space. i just don't wanna live anymore. please don't go up looking suicide hotlines. i am not going to pull a juliet over a guy. all i mean is that if a bus was headed my way my first instinct won't be to move out of the way, it would require more effort. i don't want a rebound either. what's the point? one of us would get hurt anyways and i think i am just done with love. one particularly saddening concern is that i don't enjoy rain anymore. i have always had a sort of innate childish excitement towards rain. you know how there's like an internal excitement when you go on a roller coaster. i used to automatically get that whenever it rained, without fail even if i was in a depressive episode. it just had to rain and i would get out of my funk. it was just very internal. but it just is sad how i am very indifferent towards it now. i don't want to be indifferent, i want my old excitement back but now it rains and i can't care less. i am hoping it gets better when i head back to college but i doubt it will. i can't fathom running into him or his friends, i know i will just break down at the sight. sometimes, just sometimes, for brief moments i think it's going to be okay and i become normal but it just lasts for like 10 minutes and it's back to zombieland again. i would have married him with a paper ring, stuck out through thick and thin but i guess it's just it huh. thanks for reading my sad little rant. even if you don't have any advice to offer, i am still very grateful that you took your time out to read. hope your day is way better than mine.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.010951403148528405,0.01163586584531143,0.1026694045174538,5.0,0.0
"three years of silence it’s been three years. three years… and i haven’t heard her voice. not even once. no message. no call. no sign that i still exist in her world. and yet—she still lives in mine. i know she’s with someone else now. maybe he gives her the things i couldn’t… the stability, the readiness, the future she deserved. and i hope—truly hope—she’s happy. but deep inside, there’s a quiet ache that never stops whispering: “she was the one.” because i didn’t love her like the others. she wasn’t just another chapter. she was the whole book. and people say, “you’ll fall in love again.” but what they don’t understand is: i never “fell” in love with her— i became love when i was with her. since she left, i’ve refused to be with anyone else. not because i’m trying to be loyal to a ghost. but because i know how it feels to be loved for real— and i won’t fake it with anyone just to fill the silence. i’ve made that mistake before… got close to someone just to numb the emptiness she left behind. but all i did was hurt someone who didn’t deserve that pain. and i won’t do it again. not because i’m strong— but because i fear god… and i fear breaking a heart the way mine was broken. so now, i’m fighting this battle alone. quietly. without posting about it. without asking for pity. just me… and the memory of her… against the weight of time. some nights i think: “maybe love isn’t for me.” maybe marriage… family… happiness— they all belong in a life that just isn’t mine. because how do you recreate something so real… so deep… so once-in-a-lifetime? you don’t. and maybe i’m not supposed to. i’m not looking for a new story. i’m still living in the one i never got to finish. because the feelings i had with her— they weren’t ordinary. they were indescribable. they were sacred. and some things… you just don’t replace.",breakup,1,1836.0,371.0,6.0,0.016172506738544475,0.018867924528301886,0.08355795148247978,1.0,0.0
"advice? i feel as though i need advice on whether or not im right or wrong in what i said. (backstory: my ex and i were really happy, but behind the scenes we couldn’t go 3 days without an argument that escalated to the point where i was being given death threats by the person who was meant to love me the most. yet it was always me who was saying sorry.) we broke up 3 weeks ago because he said he needed a 2-3 month break from women due to his grandma being in hospital with terminal cancer. he said the whole we can still be friends and talk and everything. i knew his grandma did have cancer, but not that it was terminal. when we were together, he was so protective of me. i felt as though i had to me evil to men- i couldn’t talk or interact with them without him getting mad at me. so obviously, feeling free, i felt as though i could do anything now. i rang someone he used to be friends with, telling him what happened. i then told my ex and he proceeded to block me. i was like… okay? so fast forward like a week, i found out he went around telling everybody our private business. that really pissed me off, so i went off on one and said something about him. it was true, im friends with his ex and she backed me up. i didn’t care that everybody knew, he did the same to me. he found out that i’d told people and then went around spreading an insane rumour that is completely false and ridiculous to the point nobody believes him. the only reason i knew about this rumour was through one of his friends, who at night i proceeded to call and tell him the full story and he was like your in the right. he then messaged my ex saying stop saying stuff and told him that i was trying to apologize. i couldn’t message him myself cause he’d blocked me. my ex took this apology and brushed it off, telling me to fuck off and i don’t deserve an apology. fast forward another week, i was already struggling. i then had a friend of mine come up to me and tell me my ex said my house reeks of cigarettes and that it’s disgusting- as if he wasn’t here like everyday. i was so annoyed, but i realised that i was just gonna be the bigger person and ask people who had been to my house if it did indeed smell and all of them said no. so i was like “right okay just ignore him”. oh i forgot to mention at this point he’d already gotten on about 2 girls and was flirting with all my friends (they didn’t reciprocate and instead told me). you know so that whole “i need a break from girls” this was bullshit. so, 2 days ago i had messaged his friend asking why he broke up with me, because i had been told lots of stories. i got told the full story- he told me my ex broke up with me because he felt as though i was holding him back and just needed an excuse. so i told his friend everything that happened about all these rumours and the only additional thing i had said was that he was a liar because…. well he did? yesterday i received a message from my ex saying “why have you been spreading stuff about me”. i told him what id said (he already knew) and why i said it. he denied everything about telling other people, but i had that many people i couldnt believe him. so i sent a huge paragraph telling him how i feel and how i’m not over him blahblahblah and he said he wasn’t gonna read that. he threatened me with the “i can ruin you” i said ive told people to stop saying stuff but you’ve gone around saying more stuff about me then i have about you. he was like whatever and ok and just blocked me again. tl,dr: lying ex, spiralling rumours, blanked apologies and threats 🥹.",breakup,1,3575.0,687.0,7.5,0.02094972067039106,0.002793296089385475,0.11871508379888268,3.0,0.0
"dont judge i still like her hi, i wanted to ask something. i once met a woman — she was beautiful, both in appearance and character. when i met her, i already had a girlfriend, but i just wanted to use her as a distraction because i saw the end of my relationship coming. eventually, my relationship ended, and three months later, i got together with that woman. i was an asshole — i forbade things that i did myself and played with her emotions. nevertheless, she always treated me with respect. two months into the relationship, she secretly took my phone and went through everything. she found pictures from my vacation with my ex and chats with several other women. she confronted me, cried, and even met with my ex a few times. but after one week, she forgave me — although the trust was completely gone. in december, she finally broke up with me for good because i was still the same person. after that, there was no contact until the end of may. i reached out again, we met, and decided to give it another try. we had a lot of fun — she was very affectionate, wanted to see me often, and things were going well. we had some arguments here and there, but after one big fight, she messaged me saying she couldn’t do it anymore and didn’t see a future with us. i told her: “alright, then block me and that’s it.” she didn’t do it. now it’s been silence since monday, and i know she’ll contact me again — but do you think it’s okay to take her back, or should i leave her for good?",breakup,1,1484.0,285.0,7.0,0.02456140350877193,0.007017543859649123,0.11929824561403508,1.0,0.0
"is it normal to forget the bad things they did? right now i’m in the phases where i can’t remember how anxious and stressed i was during the relationship, but, i know i was. i have the journals and text messages to prove it but thinking of those times doesn’t hurt so much. i broke up with my gf of 1.5 years 3 weeks ago. she had diagnosed depression and had some avoidant habits which made me anxious a lot of the time, unsure of where we stood, especially because they would ask for breaks every 6/7 months as she would start having doubts about the relationship. toward the end of the relationship there was no affection or effort from her and everyday i was walking on eggshells to avoid a break up text. but now, looking back through old messages and replaying old conversations it doesn’t jump as much, and i’m starting to doubt my decision. is this normal? i feel so stuck. i’m worried i made the wrong decision or maybe i’m just forgetting what went wrong as a way of bargaining? has anyone else had this before??",breakup,1,1021.0,194.0,3.0,0.015463917525773196,-0.015463917525773196,0.08762886597938144,5.0,0.0
"how do i stop feeling unworthy when i compare myself to their new gf? hey everyone, so i had a messy situation with this dude a year ago. we started talking when i was f22 and he was m29. theres more to the story here but things are too complicated and messy but i’ll just explain what happened in the second part. we were friends with benefits i guess but basically he cut me off in the beginning after the first time i went to his house because he felt like i was getting attached. after he left, he came back because we bumped into each other after months of no contact. he knew that i already had feelings for him prior to that because i told him and made it known thru my actions. anyway, this guy gave me mixed signals, he brought up marriage a few times to me and we had serious conversations about it saying that if things went well between us, he would want to propose to me, on top of that he continued to flirt with me and made sexual implications etc. we went out and had dinner, he sent me home and he gave me a long hug like he didnt want to let me go, i assumed we were heading in that direction. i texted him the day after to tell him i missed him because i was traveling and he replied me with “thanks for letting me know.” i was furious because its obvious as hell that he was leading me on by giving me mixed signals when he had no intention of dating or marrying me. i confronted him, and he played the victim card and he said he thought i knew this was a friendship? there was no accountability whatsoever from his end. i would have respected it more if he was clear on what he wanted from the beginning because friends dont do that. anyway, 2 months after that he started dating someone new. she seems like a sweet girl but man.. i cant help compare myself to her. she’s older than i am and she seems like she has her shit together. in terms of looks, from an objective standpoint, i guess im prettier but she seems like she has an amazing personality i cant help but wonder if maybe i didnt call him out on his bs maybe we would have a chance or maybe if i was more like his new girlfriend, maybe he would date me. it just sucks that they always settle down with the girl they date after me. why wasn’t i enough to settle down with? why am i only lusted over and not loved? i just dont feel good enough.",breakup,1,2326.0,462.0,5.0,0.010822510822510822,0.004329004329004329,0.11038961038961038,4.0,0.0
"my favorite stranger i wasn’t always like this. there was a time before her—a time when i knew what i loved, when i had passions that kept me up at night and dreams that pulled me out of bed in the morning. i had favorite things, favorite songs, favorite places, favorite smells. i had me. now… i’m just trying to remember. trying to remember who i was before she painted herself across every inch of my world. trying to get back to that version of me, the one untouched by her magic. and it’s not easy—not when the thing i’m healing from is the most beautiful thing i’ve ever had. you see, we usually heal from pain, from betrayal, from things that broke us. but how do you heal from something that made you feel so alive? how do you heal from heaven? because that’s what she was. when she was next to me, the world stopped spinning. everything faded. i didn’t need anyone else, didn’t want anyone else. she had this way of making me feel like i was floating… like my soul was flying through sunlight, unchained. my heart would dance, my soul would laugh. i wasn’t just in love—i was love. with her, i was free and safe all at once. but now she’s gone. and i’m stuck trying to pull myself out of something that never hurt me in the first place. isn’t that strange? to suffer from something so beautiful? to bleed from a memory that once made your heart bloom? she touched me in ways no one else ever will—not just my skin, not just my body, but my spirit. with a glance, she could calm every storm i was hiding. with a laugh, she could make time feel like a soft breeze on a spring day. and now, all i have are echoes. echoes of her eyes. echoes of her soul. echoes of a feeling that still makes my chest tighten when i try to breathe. but i have to do it. i have to let go. i have to make her my favorite stranger. it breaks something inside me just writing those words. but what else can i do? i can’t live in the past. i can’t keep feeding myself on memories while starving my future. so, i’m learning to love myself again—not because it’s easy, but because it’s the only way to survive. i’m trying to forgive myself for losing who i was. i’m trying to smile again for no reason. to laugh without her voice in my head. to sleep without her warmth in my chest. and every day, i dig deeper—through the memories, the pain, the beauty, the loss. i’m searching for that boy i used to be. the one who had dreams. the one who had light in his eyes without needing someone else to ignite it. this journey is hard. it’s brutal. but it’s mine. and maybe, just maybe… when i find him again— that boy who once knew exactly who he was— he’ll smile and say, “welcome back. i missed you.” and that’s when i’ll know i’m finally healing. even if i still remember her as the girl who once made me taste heaven.",breakup,1,2796.0,570.0,3.0,0.005263157894736842,0.0035087719298245615,0.11052631578947368,5.0,0.0

"post breakup drama. what do i do? backstory so i brokeup with my bf about 3 months back. he didn't cheat, things just didn't workout between us. he is a surgery resident and i'm studying for a huge exam. even when we were together he was always busy. i have worked with him so i know it gets really busy so i understood him and didn't disturb him. but he just felt too distant. he never saw my messages, never talked to me properly. and he would never pay attention to me when we go on dates. like he wouldn't even look at me! i talked to him about it. voiced out how it felt like he wasn't interested. all i asked for him is to message me atleast once a week so i can know what's going on in his life and update him about mine. i was going through a lot emotionally at that time. but then he would gaslight me about being too sensitive and that i didn't have a job yet (was studying 10+ hours a day) so i wouldn't know how hard residency is. see, i was pretty sure i wasn't toxic but then i wanted to know if i did something wrong so i would ask him if i am the one not understanding him. i would ask him why he wouldn't even smile when he is with me. or why he couldn't text/ talk with me properly. and he would give me vague answers saying no or would just say that i was torturing him in a not-serious tone. we were together for 1.5yrs and we were happy only for the first 3 months. our relationship was fun, we would go out eat, have fun. he talked to me and showed me all those cute gesture where he would randomly kiss my hand or stroke my hand. i was literally so in love with him. but then it all went down, he started ignoring me. i was bawling my eyes out every single month. i talked to my friends about it any they said it's a normal phase in a relationship and i held on. around the start of march he called me drunk and asked me if we should break up. his fam didn't approve of me because i belonged to a different religion and was torturing him mentally for a long time so he couldn't take it anymore. i knew about his fam looking for an alliance for him but we thought we can handle it together when the time comes. so this was a shock, i told him to please wait and that we can handle this. my exams were really close at that time and my future depends on it so i literally begged him to wait. days go by and around the mid of march he calls me again (drunk) and tells me he wants to marry me asap. he will leave his parents and demanded i should leave mine too. what. i'm from india so living with parents is normal. but this guy says i should not even invite my parents (who approves him and met him multiple times) to the marriage. i was in shock. i did not want to marry a man who has me in the far bottom of his priority list. and the way he treated me gave me an insight on how my life will be if i married him. i said no i'm not gonna marry you now i want some time. i told him how he had treated me and that i wasn't sure if it was really because he was busy. and also i have exams coming up. and when i tell you the words that came out of this man was so bad i was fuming. i am a very very patient person and this guy just broke my last straw. he started gaslighting me that i should marry him as i loved him and that i have too many expectations. mind you he got me nothing on my birthday and on our 1 year relationship anniversary even when i told him i liked to buy and receive gifts. i got stuff for him and i also pay for our meals sometimes so i'm pretty sure i am not a gold digger. he started swearing at me for about 30 mins. i said its over i didn't wanna be with him anymore. but the next day he calls me and said he didn't remember what he talked the night before cos he was drunk. the audacity. i broke up with him saying i don't want to go through that anymore and guess what he slipped some sentences from last night's convo, he actually remembers it all! and i have him blocked now. it is really hard though, i loved him so much but i am clear enough to not go back to him. present drama so i have a guy best friend whom i have known for almost 10 years. he is attractive and he also finds me attractive. he asked me if we could have a one night stand. both of us didn't want any commitment. he is in the army and that also makes it impossible for us to meet regularly. i was in my post breakup phase and said yes to him. i really wanted to focus on myself and have fun. but then recently i feel bad. i want to go for it but at the same time i don't want to. we have talked about the day and planned it all. it felt good, i was having fun talking to him. but i'm still not over my ex (i am not going back to him). and i'm really confused if i should just go for it or not. i am not the kind of person who does one night stands but i really wanna have fun this time. but the inner me is conflicted. what do i do?",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.01,0.004,0.129,2.0,0.0

"i know this is long, but please help me! i need advice! bf 28 gf 34 so to kind of sum up things i met this man at work and we became friends and after about a year we started dating, he was all the things i was looking for in a man, and we got a long super well, same sense of humor, political values etc. he was super reassuring, i was in love he was in love, pretty normal. however i had a kidney transplant when i was 20…and they don’t last forever. unfortunately, about 11months into our relationship (saying i love you) my transplant kidney rejected. now i was fully transparent about everything when we were just friends about my illness, and then when this happened i had a convo with him about how things were gunna be hard and i was gunna be sick, and if he needed to pull back and we can be friends for awhile that’s ok. he said if “i leave you now i never loved you” (haha) any way life continued i was/am doing dialysis, he is still telling me “we’re gunna get married” “we can get through anything” “i love you more than anyone i’ve ever been with” i think things are hard but with him they are good, he’s super supportive. we are both nurses btw. we don’t live together, my family is kinda of traditional so that’s not my thing until marriage, he didn’t care. then in jan2025 i had to move back in with my parents out of my apartment cause i was just struggling, but i still went to his house as many days a week as i could. but i’m doing dialysis 3x a week…but he golfs so he does that when we aren’t together. things are a little boring, he works nights so he’s sleeping all the time, we aren’t alone a lot (he lives with his sister/bil/niece) but life is continuing and i just think eh it’s our first rough patch we’ve gone through worse things we’ll get back to normal soon. our 2nd yr anniversary was may 21, we talked about getting married, made sure we were on the same page, then 3 days later he ended things. i had texted him earlier that week saying i felt like he was a little down, sleeping all the time, i was worried he was depressed. he said he was feeling kind of down but trying to hide it. i said well let’s talk and see what we can do together to work through it. that’s i thought we were doing when we met up to talk…the first thing he said was “you’re not gonna like this conversation” the breakup lasted 30mins and he was gone. he mumbled “what if you die at 50 and leave me with a kid” (i’m 34 and have no issues except kidney failure, other than that i’m relatively healthy) and “i don’t wanna do this anymore, i’m not happy”. i was completely blindsided, he never said anything to me about being unhappy in our relationship. he has since gone no contact. won’t answer texts, calls nothing. his sister and bil will talk to me but they don’t know what happened either. but they say he’s made up his mind and won’t change it. i think he is an avoidant personality, he never complained about anything to me, and i kind of had to make sure and be the one to bring up “relationship check-ins” and he said he struggled with that in past relationships. but that didn’t really bother me because he was so forthcoming about his love and our future. i’m confused, idk what happened, or what to do. why didn’t he just talk to me?? we hardly ever had a fight, it wasn’t toxic, no one cheated. wtf happened? i miss him so much, and i miss his friendship. he was my best friend. also, i adopted a dog from his mom, march 2024, when i first got sick cause i was unable to work and he thought it’d be good to have a companion and something to do. and he said he’d help cause it was gunna be his dog too, i footed the bill, he’s registered to me, and the dog lived with me. however like i said i had to move back in with my parents, and they didn’t want the dog at their house so my bf said he’d watch him. i was honestly struggling at that point to take care of him anyway, which wasn’t fair to our dog. for the past 6mo he’s been with him. but i obviously was down there as much as i could be. well now we aren’t together. i still need my parents help so i can’t take our dog from him. but i miss so much. i love our dog. i wanted to come see him 2wks ago and i found out from his mom that my bfs sister has been complaining about the dog so she offered to watch him for a couple weeks (seems like convenient timing) she lives an hour away from me and i still do dialysis 3x a week so it’s hard for me to do much. so i don’t know what to do. i feel like he’s still my dog and i know i can’t take care of him, at least not right now. my bf loves him and i’m also not a petty person to take the dog when i can’t give him a good life right now. but i still want to see him. i don’t know how to handle this. i need advice!",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.0,0.007049345417925478,0.015105740181268883,0.11681772406847936,3.0,0.0

"it wasn’t a romantic breakup, but it broke me just as bad — how do i move on? i know this might not be a “traditional” breakup story, but it feels just like one to me. i lost two people who meant everything — not because they hurt me, but because my own mind ruined everything. fzn was my best friend. more than a friend — a brother. someone i trusted blindly. when he got close to someone else — atc — jealousy hit me hard. i felt replaced. forgotten. but instead of talking to him, i shut down. became distant, cold, moody, and selfish. even then, he never left. he stayed patient. he stayed kind. atc was kind, too. but i expected too much. constant attention, instant replies — things she couldn’t always give. i got upset when she didn’t meet those expectations. when i saw her bond with fzn grow, my insecurities exploded. one day, i showed up at her office for an internship hoping for a simple acknowledgement — but she didn’t even look at me. that moment broke me inside. after all this, i spiraled. i stopped studying. i failed exams for the first time. i hated myself for how i acted, for ruining something that never deserved to break. but they never disrespected me. they never pushed me away. they just stayed… silent. i don’t know how to move on from this. **how do you forgive yourself for hurting people who never hurt you?** **how do you rebuild after breaking down and losing what you loved?** if you’ve been through a breakup like this — where you lost someone you depended on emotionally, not romantically — please share your advice. how do you heal when your own mind was the one that broke everything? thanks for reading.",breakup,1,1644.0,299.0,7.5,0.026755852842809364,0.0,0.0903010033444816,4.0,0.0
"the letter he’ll never read dear a, we had a love that was unforgettable in the beginning. i still remember our first date, how nervous i was just to get through dinner. you helped me relax by ordering my favorite tequila, extra añejo, like you already knew me. i was dressed to impress, and you showed up in a plaid long sleeve shirt. what was supposed to be a short coffee date turned into a full night of adventures. by the time i got home at 4 a.m., i knew something had shifted. it felt right. like we’d found something rare. i thought i had found the one. my soul felt at peace. my body felt safe with you. every moment with you felt like the best moment of my life…until it didn’t. when the honeymoon phase ended, real life hit harder than either of us were ready for. my daughter wasn’t prepared. skeletons started falling out of closets. and little by little, the glimmer in my eyes began to fade as the truth started to show. the abuse started subtly. boundaries you once respected suddenly disappeared. people you said were fine for me to be around became off-limits. if you weren’t invited, i couldn’t go. no makeup, suddenly there’s a dress code to follow. the yelling started. the accusations. the paranoia. and then… it turned physical. pushed to the floor. slammed into walls. hair pulled. hit, though “it was not that hard otherwise you’d be dead,” you’d say. my phone, broken four times. my work laptop, smashed. an airbnb, damaged. through all of it, i was the one getting you help: rehab, detox, mental health support. tried everything to help you get back up from your feet. but nothing stuck. you kept spiraling, and i kept losing myself. you accused me, again and again, of sleeping with other people. despite everything, i stayed. i loved you through it. i clung to the hope that something might change. and then came the bumble account. you said i “killed you” the moment you found out. but you don’t understand you were killing me, every single day. slowly, silently, painfully. yes, i made a bumble account during the four days we were broken up. no, i didn’t go out with anyone. i didn’t give anyone my number. i deleted it quickly. i was just… desperate. i needed conversation. i needed someone to remind me i was still worth something. that i wasn’t the “trash,” the “stupid,” the “piece of shit mom” you kept telling me i was. i shouldn’t have been searching for that in strangers. but the truth is, i was shattered inside. and i was trying to find a sliver of warmth that used to come from you. all i ever wanted was to love and be loved in return. but you took advantage of my kindness, my loyalty, my nurturing heart and gave me fear in return. a part of me still longs for you. but not the you i know now. i long for the version of you that made me feel like home. not the monster i came to fear. i don’t know exactly how i’ll move forward from here. but i know the right thing, the thing i owe to myself, and to my daughter, is to do it without you. even if my heart still loves you. even if it aches. even if the grief shows up in waves. because love is not supposed to hurt this much. and i am finally learning to love myself more than the idea of someone who couldn’t. goodbye. —m",breakup,1,3219.0,621.0,4.0,0.00644122383252818,0.01288244766505636,0.10466988727858294,0.0,0.0
"what to do when you realize you were unwell/the problem my boyfriend and i broke up in february/march. in that time, i was drinking heavily and would text him asking for help/closure. he would respond in an amicable way, but affirming his boundaries of wanting space, and i would respond emotionally and with anger. our breakup was mutual. honesty, i don’t remember much of 2025. i know i was extremely unwell and going through additional trauma while the breakup was happening. but i look back on our messages before he blocked me on everything, and i realize that i was the problem. i don’t remember saying all of that. i don’t even remember feeling that way. but it’s hard to move on- the “his loss” attitude doesn’t apply when i have so much guilt about my behavior in the end. has anyone else been through this? what do i do? i am in therapy and working on all of this. but i am so deeply traumatized by losing this person who was my entire world and who my entire life was structured around. it’s going to take years to heal, and i’m not sure if i’ll ever heal fully. please help me.",breakup,1,1089.0,212.0,3.0,0.014150943396226415,0.0,0.1179245283018868,2.0,0.0

"two years down the drain hello all! please excuse the very long winded post. i (23m) recently got broken up with by my (21f) ex-girlfriend of roughly two years. this came as a bit of a shock, as all breakups are. until now, everything seemed rather peachy! sure, we argued just about as much as any other couple, but we were always quick to communicate and come to an agreement. otherwise, things seemed fantastic! i truly thought i found ""the one"" and was even making some engagement plans. however, there was one immediate, glaring issue. we had just entered long distance as of may, where we would be a 6 hour drive from each other. initially, this didn't seem to be a huge issue. my plan was that we would rotate who goes to who every two weeks. thus, there would've been minimal burnout and we would've seen each other on a fairly regular basis. this worked better in theory than in practice. unfortunately, she was not able to afford either the gas or plane ticket because summer break from college just began, and she is hunting for an internship. this was no problem, as i bought a plane ticket to fly her up to my state because i drove to her place last time (the plane ticket would've been a surprise). unfortunately, the distance was too much and she broke up with me on the 25th. to her credit, the distance was going to be for a very long time. i recently commissioned into the army, and will be traveling across the country at the whims of the military. whereas she plans on settling for a postgraduate program in nyc. furthermore, my contract with the service is about 7 years long, so not insignificant by any means. i was in the midst of working out a plan to be able to see her by strategically using vacation days and long weekends to fly to see her, but she saw this as too vague and inconsistent. who can blame her? she was probably right. this was too much for her, so she broke up with me. to be fair, i chose this life, not her, so i don't have the right to blame her for not subjecting herself to nearly a decade of uncertainty. but i still loved her so much, which makes it hurt so much worse. the breakup was over the phone. tough, but fair given the circumstances. she cited how miserable she always felt when i wasn't there. she said that she loved me too much to not be with me on a regular basis. she spoke about her experience during a deployment i was sent on to eastern europe and how miserable she was during that (again, very fair). she said she doesn't want to endure that again. to me (in my delusional, post breakup opinion), this seems a touch contradictory. she loves me and hates not being with me so much that she has to break up with me? odd. seems like there is something more here. through the tears and sobbing tribulations, i made the ultimate mistake of breaking my own rule, no contact. i called her the following night and morning after with clarifying questions. please note that i have been very understanding and respectful in this entire endeavor and have not ever questioned her decision to do this or have asked her to take me back (which was very, very difficult). i've learned from a previous breakup that anything other than this leaves you feeling like a fool in a few months, so i approached this with that memory in mind. anyways, she disclosed to me that in our time of long distance, i haven't been communicating as much. this has been a very valid argument, as i can be pretty independent. moreover, she said that i wouldn't make the necessary sacrifices for her and that she felt neglected. i asked for examples (inappropriate in hindsight), and she brought up that i don't like to go out and ""party"" anymore. aside from the fact that i have to be up at 5:30 every weekday for work, i have kinda grown out of partying at local college bars. this was in combination with a few other things she brought up, which are probably perfectly reasonable and fatal errors on my part. however, i felt like i did an ok job all in all. when we lived in the same town, we practically lived and did everything with one another. when apart, we called for at least half an hour almost every single day. i know distance makes things difficult, but what more could i have done? therefore, this leads me to believe that she fell out of love with me some time ago. i think the distance factor was an excuse to preserve my feelings (i am appreciative of that, by the way), as the true reason behind her leaving me was gaps in my character. nonetheless, i miss her a great deal. she was the greatest friend and partner i've ever had. i wish nothing but the best for her. ideally, that would be me, but i can try and settle for her moving on to another man (excuse the crude joke). it is my hope that someday, during the no contact, she will call me back, begging to be with me again. of course, i will say ""no"" and tell her that i deserve better (i am, of course, lying. i will cave instantly). it's my greatest fear that she will move on quickly and start seeing other guys. though none of my business, i am insecure at the moment, so i ask that you all excuse my opinions. i just want her to read my mind and call me. i want her to apologize for being silly and to say she was wrong, but in my heart, i think i know that i am the problem, and i think she already emotionally left me some time ago. thank you all for your time. i apologize for the lack of coherence. i did just get dumped after all. for all the young men out there suffering through this like me, i stand with your lamentation in solidarity with you. this absolutely sucks, but hey, we ball.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.017094017094017096,0.003798670465337132,0.08736942070275404,3.0,0.0

"he made sex feel safe. (trigger warning: mention of a previous sexual assault !!!) in my teenage years, i was assaulted. since then, i have always struggled with intimacy. the idea of sex was terrifying to me. my only association with it was pain and fear. he was so damn patient. we took everything at my own pace. he was my first everything. he showed me that sex is supposed to fun, not painful! that it was supposed to be loving, warm, and feel good! he always prioritised my pleasure over his own. he always checked in on me and asked if i was alright. we would shower together after sex, and giggle while we washed each other's hair and bodies. now he is gone. the man who saw my deepest and darkest fears is gone. i bared my soul and body to him. i can't help but feel betrayed. i have never felt more vulnerable with someone. the idea of having sex with someone else, having to go through that process of revealing my past and deepest fears all over again is scaring me so bad. i'm not sure if i can ever feel go through that feeling of vulnerability ever again. i am scared that the next time i have sex with someone, it'll be like all the times before meeting my ex - violent, angry, and painful. i am scared that no one else would have the patience he did. it took me 7 months to muster up the courage to do penetrative sex with him. it took me another 2/3 months to be fully comfortable with it. what if no one else would be willing to wait for me, like how he waited? my body yearns for him. his big and warm hands, his touch, his smell, his smile, his soft voice asking if he should stop whenever my body freezes up. sometimes it got to be too much, i'd ask for a break, and we'd cuddle for a couple of minutes. his body was so damn warm. my complicated relationship with sex made me feel like i was inherently broken, but he'd cup my face and feel like i was the only woman in the whole wide world. while our break up was fairly amicable, due to both of us having inherently very different personalities and needs, i feel so betrayed. i showed you the most shameful part of me, and this is what i get in return?",breakup,1,2126.0,409.0,6.0,0.014669926650366748,0.0,0.10268948655256724,2.0,0.0

"how do i navigate this situation im in? gave everything for her and she made me leave. to put this into context, i've been with this girl for a little over a year. our love is extremely strong. it is both our first serious relationship, she is 22, and i am 23. we met each other in college. loved each other hard and damn near immediately. it felt so right. i met her parents before we even started officially dating. she made many mistakes in rhe beginning, doing things that were close to unforgivable, and most people would leave (never cheating or anything like that from either of us). and i accepted those mistakes because we had been telling each other we see a future with each other and love each other so much and can't wait to get married and have kids. her family all agreed i was the first boyfriend they officially met and was like, damn, he's a good person. she finally found someone good. fast forward to 3 months ago, we move to a new state together. my family is back where we used to go to college, and her family is in the new state we just moved to. i have no one here but here. this is where i start to make mistakes. she also has her best friend move in with us (horrible idea), and she hates me as well. the tables have turned, and i'm the one making mistakes now. and because of that, she decides to leave and wants to grow, but apart. she says i am too reliant on her, and haven't made any new connections in the new state, but she has her best friend and her entire family at her fingertips. my family and friends are 15 hours away. we took this leap in life because we thought this would be forever. and now she is making me leave, because she thinks i will never grow for myself, and love myself for myself. i wrote her a letter, pouring my entire heart out on paper. begged for forgiveness and a chance. it wasn't enough. moving out tomorrow... do i still allow the door to be open for reconnection later in life? i know there's some missing pieces that people on here won't know, but of course it's too personal to go on the internet. we both still love each other very much, and will miss each other. we have two cats together too, and i'll be back in a month or so to come get one of them that i paid for. just can't take him right now due to the circumstances. do i grow apart and never look back? or do i allow the chance for it to be something again. obviously i want the latter, but i don't know what's good for me right now.",breakup,1,2462.0,475.0,5.0,0.010526315789473684,0.016842105263157894,0.08210526315789474,3.0,0.0

"i'm starting to believe that most of my relationship problems and trauma would've been avoided if i was just a bad guy. anyone else have this curse where you always end up dating a woman who's ""never been treated this way before""? in my younger days, i saw this as the greatest honour. to be here first good guy, to be the one who proves her wrong that all men suck, to give her hope. now, whenever i hear that, the first thought that comes to my mind is ""crapdammit, not another one."" as i'm sure most of us know, the moment you her something she never had, she shows you exactly why she never had it. and i'm really confused as to why i'm still suffering this cycle because i'm aware that in this life, you attract what you are, not what you want. and i took two years away from dating to intentionally work on bettering myself. and i didn't even do all that work to have better luck with dating, i did it for me. but i still hoped that once i put myself back out there again, there would be as much of a change on the outside as there was on the inside. but no, still the same story every freakin time. maybe my problem that i was changing for the better, when i should've been changing for the worst. those type of guys clearly play the dating game on easy mode anyway. unfortunately, i have too strong of a moral code to be that type of guy anyway, so my only recourse is to just cut my loses and play a different game, since love wasnt made for me. _*edit*_ before i log off and leave this steaming pile of a clown show to burn itself to the ground, i'd like to take a moment to separate the real ones who heard me out, from the bitter ones who projected onto me. to the real ones. thank you. thank you for the taking the time to understand where i was coming from, empathize with my frustration, share your own similar experiences to assure me that i'm not alone in this struggle, and even those try to help me unpack my frustration and find a solution. your empathy is what keeps spaces like this alive and encourages more open and vulnerable dialogue from those suffering in silence looking for someone to help shoulder their pain. you didn't twist my words. you didn't tear me down, you listened. and that means more to me than any solution you could have provided. which a lot of you did. now to the others. to the ones who didn't come here looking to add to an open and honest conversation. to the ones who saw a man opening up about his frustration with an ongoing pattern in his love life and felt the need to tear him down for it. the ones who let their unresolved traumas be the driving force of their comprehension skills when dealing with men, let me be clear. i am not your ex. i am not the guy who manipulated you, ghosted you, abused you, cheated on you, or whatever he did. i am just another man who was brave enough to speak openly about something i've been going through and actively doing the work to overcome. i didn't come here seeking validation, pity or praise. i came here to unpack, much like everyone else in this subreddit. but you, you didnt come here to understand me. you came here to use me as an emotional punching bag for your own vindication from the injustices you suffered at the hands of a man from your past. you find it easier to imprint your toxic ex onto a total stranger and aim your resentment at him than healing. if all you got from what my post was that i hate women, or i'm an undercover f boy, then that says more about you and the stories you tell yourself in your own mind, than it does about me or anyone else. yall will be the same ones who pester men to be more open and vulnerable only to respond to their open hands with closed fists like they didn't read the undisclosed fine print which states that our vulnerability should be expressed on your terms. you're free to be as maladaptive in your perception of reality and men as you like if it helps you sleep at night. but what you're not going to do is conflate the imaginary villain you created in your mind with the man in real life just telling the truth. good day.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,4.0,0.005115089514066497,0.005115089514066497,0.054987212276214836,1.0,0.0

"need some major help i 19m need some advice. i've been with my girlfriend 22f for a year . we're both full-time college students and work as well — i work nights in a professional setting, and she works days at a fast food restaurant. i truly believe i love her, but over time i've been feeling more and more unhappy in the relationship. one of the things that really gets to me is her short temper. she gets extremely upset over small things — for example, if clothes aren’t put away by color or if something doesn't go exactly how she wants, she’ll get an attitude and become really short with me. i understand that money isn’t everything, and i don’t mind being generous, but it’s starting to feel very one-sided. i make significantly more money due to my job, and since we started dating last august, i’ve paid for every dinner and date. she rarely offers to pay for anything, but she doesn’t hesitate to spend money on outings with her friends. even when she says she’s taking me out, i usually still end up covering the bill while she just leaves the tip. it just feels unbalanced. but at the same time i know i make more money so at the same time i understand. things started to shift for me around four months in when i found out she had been texting other guys. the messages were clearly flirtatious, and she had sent them sexually suggestive pictures — no nudity, but obviously meant to seek attention. what really hurt was that these guys didn’t even know she was in a relationship. when i questioned her early on, she insisted they were just coworkers and became defensive, which only made it harder for me to trust her — even before i discovered the full extent of what was going on. i truly believe she’s changed when it comes to seeking attention from other guys — i haven’t seen anything like that happen again since. but despite that, i’ve been feeling more and more emotionally distant. it’s gotten to the point where i had a dream that we got married, and in the dream, i completely regretted it — i felt trapped and miserable. that really shook me. i don’t fully know how to make sense of it because i do love her, but at the same time, i’m starting to question whether love alone is enough when i feel this disconnected. just looking for some insight.",breakup,1,2272.0,429.0,1.0,0.002331002331002331,0.004662004662004662,0.08158508158508158,0.0,0.0
"she listened to her friends instead of talking to me long story ahead hi! i just recently broke up with my gf for 2 years ( 3 years this november ) i don't have anyone to talk to about this and i hope everyone here has some advice to give about break ups. i’m 26 (m) and my gf is 29. we’ve been together for almost 3 years now but we have lived together for more than a year. our life seemed pretty stable, we both earn more than the average salary in our our country. we have financial commitments and furbabies that i take care of. i admit that i am nowhere perfect in this relationship and so was her. communication has always been our problem ever since, she’s someone who doesn't want to talk after a fight. we had so many petty fights that we fixed or moved on without having to talk it out. just earlier this year we had so many petty arguments and her action is to always say she’s moving out. at first, i didn't pay much attention to that cause i know she won't, we have so many things that bonds us together. just recently, she asked if she can go out to on an island trip with her work friend and i let her because she looked like she needed some rest and she also wants to accompany her depressed friend who wants to visit another mutual friend who lives there. everthing seemed fine but when she came home she somehow changed, i felt something was wrong, i felt that she was cold. we were just chatting earlier today, she was sending videos but then suddenly she came home without even letting me know. so, i let that be, thinking she might be tired of the trip. day after that was her work day, in the morning, she was okay but then after her work she came home without letting me know and did not even talk to me. i let that go again cause she might be tired, she’s always tired because of her work. day after that, she never spoke to me not even acknowledging my presence. messages are just seen with no replies. so i confronted her and asked if i did something wrong, she did not reply just read. right then and there, i was confused, what could i have done wrong? we were just okay. i then messaged her and said i wanted to talk, she replied she wants to move out so bad. so later that night, i confronted her and asked if she doesn't like me anymore. i was looking at her face as she tries to answer my question, i asked her again if she don’t want me no more and she could not answer, just a face of hesitation. so, i confronted her about something i knew, just a few months ago, i noticed she unfriended me and unfollowed me on her socials, she also deleted our pictures together and i have always noticed that she never included me in her stories no more, that’s when she cracked. lately, she had been stressed and her responsibilities were heavy, she said she was looking for a partner but i was just a boyfriend material. she pointed that i never listened to her, i was always on the phone if she tries to lash out. i had no excuse, we did have that argument before but also because she never listened to me when i try to talk. she also pointed out that one time she needed me but i came late and i tried to reason out that i was even sick but i still came. she also pointed out when she tries to complain i always have something to say or an opinion instead of just listening. she then said she realized while she was away with her friend, they opened up to each other and friend probably told her to break up with me( idk ) because of my mistakes. i cried cause i realized that she already fell out of love, i saw the signs and ignored it. she already processed her moving on phase but she just don't have the guts of breaking up with me. i got to admit, i am happy go lucky person but that doesn't mean i didn't try to help her in her daily life that she failed to see and consider. there were so many things that i could say against her but i was just so disappointed that her perspective of me is now different. i was so sad that i could not even reason out anything anymore. i said sorry if i was not able to meet her expectations. she said she’s also aware of her lapses. tho, at the end i did say she also didn't show care to me ever since. there were so many instances( even got into an accident that i almost died and seemed like she didnt care )she doesn't even listen to me but if it is her friends saying it, she would. i told her if you only told me this before or confronted me before we got to this, we would have been able to fix this but instead, you talked to your friends and listened to them. at the end, my life and my goals was always built around her, but to her, i was never a a part of it, a disposable. but then again, if i also did try to confront her before, if only i wasnt so afraid of making arguments about things we should fix about our relationship, maybe we would not end up like this. destroyed because of not communicating and communicating to the wrong people.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.0,0.007231404958677686,0.004132231404958678,0.10640495867768596,1.0,0.0

"my “friend” is hanging out with my abusive ex. guess she’s an ex friend now too? i broke up with my emotionally abusive ex back in december after he lashed out at me for not giving him $5, which i knew was to buy beer. he is an alcoholic, lost his job several times, threw up blood, etc. i finally set a boundary around not giving him money anymore because i felt that i was enabling his addiction. he lashed out at me, called me a bunch of names, said he hated me etc, he cheated on me as well. after he lashed out at me, i said we were done and he could come get his things, he proceeded to tell me that he took pills and was going to end his life if i didn’t show up - this was a recurring thing that would happen. i always wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt, but he’d lie to me about going to therapy and aa. i finally blocked him in january and he proceeded to contact my roommates to try and get in contact with me, threatening to show up at our house, resulting in us needing to get a security camera because he previously slashed my last roommates tires. (she was crazy but that does not justify it.) and i have been no contact with him for coming up on nearly 5 months now. no contact has helped me a lot but there are some people involved in this friend group with him who i tried to stay friends with because i valued those relationships, however it seems they don’t value it the same way. i told the two girls in the group who i thought were friends, sarah and hannah, everything that happened with my ex and they even saw the messages he had blew up my phone with and they were shocked. hannah informed me my ex hadn’t been paying her boyfriend rent for months and she was upset (this was in march.) then, a few weeks ago, sarah texts me and invites me to her birthday party but says my ex is going to be there and she “totally understands the situation” and can let me know when he’s going to be there so i know when “all’s clear.” i replied and told her thank you for the invite but i don’t feel very safe going if he’s going to be around. she ignored it and never replied, two weeks go by, and today she posts a video of her hanging out with him and joking around, laughing while he’s helping her move something like wtf? am i crazy here? i already felt angry with her because she knows he’s an alcoholic and is inviting him to her birthday where there’s alcohol, then on top of it expecting me to work around that. i just am feeling super lonely in all this and like everything that happened to me is being minimized.",breakup,1,2543.0,510.0,7.5,0.025490196078431372,-0.0058823529411764705,0.09411764705882353,3.0,0.0
"did i walk away from something real, or was i just overwhelmed and avoidant? hey all — i could really use some outside perspective. i recently ended a 2-year relationship (6 months official) with someone who deeply loved me and consistently showed up for me. since the breakup, i’ve been feeling waves of sadness, guilt, doubt, and now confusion — wondering whether i made the right decision or if i just panicked and ran because of stress and internal pressure. some background: i’m a 27m military member facing a lot of career uncertainty right now — potential moves, frequent travel, and trying to figure out my long-term goals. that pressure has weighed on me in ways i’m only starting to understand. my ex (27f) was incredibly loving, loyal, and supportive. she went out of her way to show love — doing small thoughtful things, being physically affectionate, trying new things, and genuinely trying to grow for me. at times, i felt like we weren’t on the same emotional or mental page. i’m more oriented toward personal development and navigating life’s uncertainty, while she was much more focused on building a future together and was willing to adapt her life to mine — even the unpredictability of the military lifestyle. i’ve struggled with emotional avoidance — holding in concerns, avoiding conflict, and postponing difficult conversations. i also rely too heavily on things like nicotine and caffeine to stay socially and mentally engaged while numbing negative feelings. she encouraged me to quit, and while she meant well, i resented it at the time, and it caused tension. i’ve also felt unfulfilled at times — socially and lifestyle-wise. i craved more adventure, independence, spontaneity — things i felt more connected to when i was single. she didn’t prevent me from doing these things, but i often lacked the energy or drive to pursue them while in the relationship. i now realize i could’ve communicated that more clearly instead of internalizing it. she didn’t fully mesh with my friends or family in the way i hoped due to being shy. i sometimes felt like i wanted someone more naturally outgoing or emotionally resilient — especially given the demands of military life. but with all that said… she loved me deeply, and she made it clear she’d stick with me through anything. even after the breakup, she said she still would. we had amazing memories, and when we were just together, one-on-one, things often felt calm and affectionate. but i had this growing gut feeling that i was emotionally boxed in, and that staying wouldn’t be fair to either of us long-term. since then, i keep asking myself: was i just emotionally immature and avoidant? could things have been different if i had voiced my needs earlier? did i walk away from something most people never find? or was i recognizing a deeper incompatibility that love alone couldn’t fix? she still says she’d take me back if i changed my mind. and that’s killing me — because i don’t know if i should. i’m afraid i’ll miss her deeply and regret letting her go. but i’m also afraid i’d go back only out of guilt or longing, not clarity and true alignment. right now, i’m giving both of us space to reflect and get clearer. no contact, no rushing. i want to give this the seriousness it deserves. if you’ve ever gone through something similar — emotional avoidance, overthinking, breakup regret — i’d really appreciate your perspective.",breakup,1,3412.0,598.0,7.0,0.011705685618729096,0.005016722408026756,0.10367892976588629,5.0,0.0

"i broke things off and now i still feel awful. need some words of encourgement or at least someone to slap some sense into me. to give some context： i was “dating” him for about little over a year and he still did not ever dtr. at the start of it all i made it clear that i wanted a relationship. he was the one who proposed dating for a year so i gave it time, naively thinking he will make me his gf after that time. a year passed and he did nothing. during this time, i noticed that he was way comfortable physically than having any emotional connection (maybe just with me or he has avoidant characteristics). we went from seeing each other a few times a week to now once every other week. he never ever reached out to me during the week tho was present when we saw each other. whenever i reached out he would take hours to respond or not respond at all. we talked about the same few topics that he was comfortable with and there just seem to be a wall and i could never get to know the real him. looking back he has always been like this and i think a big piece of why it will not work, even if he dtr is because of the lack of communication. every time i try to bring up my feelings, he avoids it or makes it my fault. and so i broke it off with him and called him out on the way he had treated me but i feel awful. i know i made the right decision to stop wasting my own time because there has been no progression but it’s like my heart still misses what little breadcrumb he gave me. i have accepted that we want different things and this whole time he more or less treated me like a fwb and an option. how do i get over this??",breakup,1,1635.0,333.0,3.0,0.009009009009009009,0.0,0.0960960960960961,2.0,0.0

"i regret saying something in a very horrible way. truth is i mean it. but the way i say it make him hurts a lot, and i don't think we can recover from that. im just so ashamed of myself. my boyfriend (27) and i (27) have been together for more than 3 years. so he still haven't finished his bachelor degree, he said he's going to finish it since the beginning of our relationship, but until now he still haven't finish yet and i haven't seen his progress yet. before anyone judge me, some country run different than other. in my country, to get a better paying job you need at least a bachelor degree. he's working right now, but he only earn so little that he still living with her mom and not really contributing to the household. we have plan to get marry. in his current states, i think i need to wait atleast 5 years to get marry. i told him to finish his bachelor degree quickly and say that by having a degree he can get a better paying job. i then compare him with other people, said that they can get much more with the same positions as he is. he keep denying me and won't listen to me. and i end up saying horrible things and just compare him with others in terms of his financial status. tbh i feel relieved, this is such an ongoing burden for me. now i just feels ashamed of myself for hurting him and say it in a very hurtful way. he's now very upset, and won't talk to me. i don't want to defend my actions, but i do understand maybe there's a better way to say my points. now i just don't know what to do.:(",breakup,1,1523.0,297.0,0.0,0.0,0.006734006734006734,0.09427609427609428,0.0,0.0
"i'm glad they're in the past, but i'm still hurting. long story for this one. this girl (25f) and i (25m) have known each other for 10 years. she lived in austin i lived in houston. we decided to actually try for a relationship and it completely went to shit. i recently got out of a break up and a thing we both always do when we have problems with the opposite sex is try to talk to each other to see what the other thinks. well she broke up with an abusive guy some time in october while i was in a relationship with someone else. after things fell apart with the relationship i had we both connected in late february of this year. well she decided to visit me out of the blue and spent a weekend in houston with me. after i took her out to eat we went back home because she was tired from the drive then got intimate surprisingly. the rest of the day we just relaxed took a nap then went out for a drink. next day it was to the museum which was fun. i was happy just to be with her. she wanted to go see the butterfly garden and it just meant a lot to see her smile especially after all she had been through before. after that i took her to a nice wine restaurant. had drinks, had laughs just enjoyed being around one another. afterwards i drove her back to my house so she could drive home. kissed her goodbye and told her to stay safe. i was obviously over the moon about it because i thought in my dumbass head ""this is it after 10 years we might actually be able to make something work"" welp after 2 weeks i visited her and stayed at her place in austin. i drove out friday night after work. we watched bone tomahawk when i got there went out to eat and relaxed. next day i replaced the bumpers on her car because no offense she cant drive great and austin roads suck ass. we went out for breakfast went hiking with her dog crackhead watched and the cidercade. felt really relaxed and at the arcade she normally isnt really clingy or lovey dovey but she latched on to my arm and rested her head on my shoulder while we walked. my heart melted at that. after i get back and im getting ready to head home to houston she asks if we could talk outside on the back porch. she then proceeds to say she regrets having sex and regrets basically us trying to start anything. obviously my heart dropped. i tried asking why she couldn't even explain why literally saying, i dont know, which was probably a lie at this point. i told her look we've always wanted this why are you backing out now after 10 years of talking on and off. just didnt make any sense and still doesnt. at that point i felt used for my ability to fix cars paying for literally everything while we went out like she told me just to come out here so she could use me and lose me. crazy. well my dumbass persisted. i really should have just dropped it there when she did. she agreed to give it a shot but it was the most half assed thing ever. later on down the line she even said she didnt want to half ass anything with me, but we'll get there shortly. things are going somewhat smooth we text and call when we had the time found myself being the only one trying to plan a weekend together to spend time. she kept going ""oh not this week i have etc."" which i just told her to go enjoy herself. well half the time it would be something important life spending time with her dad on his birthday or drama with her mom but the other half is raves and going out to bars or on sunday allegedly rotting in bed and not doing anything. it would be believable because she does do that due to her depression but she also as i forgot when we were growing up. everytime she is down she messages guys on instragram and acts really interested just so she has a chance of getting money or just the validation and attention she craves. i should have known because ever since we've known each other she would always talk about how she fucks with people. well figured out i was now the person being fucked with mentally. she then proceeded to say she didnt want to half as anything with me over a somewhat break up text i agreed. then afterwards she wouldn't talk to me or hold a conversation but would text me i miss you once every day for a week. told her to stop and it hurts and if you dont want a relationship stop talking to me like we are still in one. awhile after that how i know she is messing with other people, her friends started to message her because someone was messaging them about something allegedly only i knew. i still dont even know what the fuck it was. on the first in the afternoon she called me about it. now recently i got a new job and drove all day and night the day vefore to get to it because i started that monday in comepletely different state on nightshift. i haven't messaged her friends ever. dont have there numbers haven't messaged anyone she knows on instagram because why would i bother wasting time begging for someone who already wants to leave. on top of that i had been driving for 16 hours straight and just got to a place and only slept 3 hours. she decides to spam call my ass demanding if im the one who was messaging her friends about something allegedly only i knew when in reality she's been messing with another dudes head all along. told her i had been bassically up for over 32 hours at this point havent messaged a single one of her friends, havent had time to then hung up. then sent a text saying if all youre going to do is message me with drama or accusations please refrain from doing so. crazy how it works i dont know why i stayed in touch with them before i never tried never bought em anything never even really cared because i knew the distance wouldn't be good. as soon as i try i just get absolutely shit on. one thing she is right about is that our friendship and anything else should be ruined. still though i feel horrible about it. dont know why. it hurts more and more every day. for awhile i was doing ok focused on my new job exploring the new state i'll be in for a few months just relaxing. yet it still claws at the back of my head with stupid questions like why couldn't she have just tried? why couldn't she put more effort in? i used to not have any resentment about it but a month later its just hitting really hard now. i dont know what to do with myself i can barely even talk to people sometimes i just keep working. i go to the lake to fish on off days. i go walking on trails in the woods. i just dont feel like being around anybody. people at the new job want to hangout i tell em sure but never follow through. i genuinely just dont want to be around people anymore. like everyone is a liar or a phony. puts on a face to make themselves seem like a good person. my friends back in texas i can barely bring myself to call. i've been talking to a therapist but they aren't really helping me right now maybe better help sucks but i cant find one in person because my job takes up most of the day. i just feel burnt out of face to face interaction. i didnt even feel like writing the whole stupid fucking story out because reliving those good and bad times hurt too much to keep journaling or typing out. if anyone has any advice on how to get over this because if i keep looking back i just start to hate them then back to stupid ass i love them and miss them. i dont know how hard it is to shake someone you've known for 10 years off of your mind but i hate it. i really fucking hate it. couldn't feel more hurt and betrayed by someone i thought i could have built a future

"please console me hello everyone. i am asking for your help. i have been together with this girl for a long time, 5 years (long distance but it has always been perfect and the last months were the best so far). i got along great with her family, we went on vacation together and it was like something from a movie. yesterday she went somewhere with her family. at some point i fell asleep. i wake up and all of a sudden i am blocked everywhere. everywhere. we had some cute couple stuff like matching names on instagram, we had our vacation playlist on spotify, it was all perfect. all of a sudden, all of that is gone. her name went back to normal, i'm blocked everywhere. nothing of us is left. i texted her mom and she is very surprised. she said she will talk to her when she gets home. i have to say we had (<- it hurts to use past tense, maybe somehow there is still hope) a very god-centered relationship. we prayed a lot together, always talked about how god brought us together because we had so much stuff in common, it's actually insane. every conversation we had, we somehow found a way to talk about god too. one od the most beautiful moments on vacation was when we prayed together. we both started crying and hugging after. now everything is gone, our matching bios were changed into a "":)"" or into an ""old account got hacked"". she posted photos that i took of her. she had some very bad girl friends that treated her badly. specifically she mentioned that she was sad for never being anyone's best friend. she was my best friend and we talked all day every day. we always said those girls were evil and she always said she is happier than ever for being away from them. we spent so much time together and it was so beautiful. she always thanked me for bringing her closer to god and farther away from those girls. we both grew closer to god together. in fact we had another vacation planned in a few weeks that we got the tickets for 2 days ago? i am very confused, heartbroken and sad. can anyone somehow console me? please just anything. thank you very much and please, please help me and pray for me. this is the worst i have ever felt.",breakup,1,2155.0,404.0,2.0,0.0049504950495049506,-0.0024752475247524753,0.09158415841584158,2.0,0.0

"just numb. is my reaction normal? my gf and i (both 22) ended things two weeks ago after a 3+ year relationship when i moved to a new city. things between us weren't the greatest for a few months prior, but it's not like we were fighting, more like relationship stagnation. it felt like the right thing to do, and honestly i think i wanted it more than her. it's my choosing that we didn't do ldr. it's been two weeks of no contact and i haven't cried since the day of the break up. i just feel numb. we were still very much friendly when we broke up and it was absolutely on good terms. we both expressed a desire to still be friends at some point, but we're doing a few months of no contact first. i thought i was over it, i thought the months of knowing things would likely end soon helped me heal, but a girl asked me out on a dating app and i nearly had a panic attack. i don't know if it was just anxiety or guilt. every day i think to myself that i should be crying, i shouldn't be functional, i should be resisting the urge to text her. sure, there have been times where i want to tell her something about my new job (which admittedly has kept me busy, at least for now), just text her a little life update or a photo of my food, times when i've checked her location (admittedly a bad idea to keep doing this) and times where i check if she's looked at my instagram story. there have been times when i've been alone and felt sad. but mostly i've just felt numb. this is my first break up. i don't really have a measure of how this is supposed to go. is my reaction normal? i'm trying to get back into therapy to unpack my feelings, but right now i don't really have friends in this city and texting my friends back home just isn't the same. i feel like i'm going through this break up all wrong and i don't really know what to do. edit: if any additional context is needed please ask, just kind of brain dumped",breakup,1,1918.0,377.0,7.5,0.023872679045092837,0.0,0.10610079575596817,2.0,0.0

"want to hear your experiences please! please read/ respond: i would love to hear experiences of living together after breaking up, getting back together after being broken up with, or anything you might feel is relevant!! so i (21f) am a week out from broken up with by my ex (21m) in my first long term relationship. i’ve broken up with others before, but both of those ended at 4 months. we had lived together with some roommates in a house we rented for college (met freshman year, lived together junior year) and supposed to live together again this year for senior year with one of the roommates. a week before he broke up with me he told me he had been feeling distant/ disconnected for a bit, even since living at the old place (not sure for how long) and was hoping the being apart this summer would do us good. we had still called every day though, so much time being apart. he said he wanted to work on it and still loved me. a couple days later us and our roommate went to his family’s camp. while there he mentioned he was still feeling distant, and felt a weird feeling in his chest that wasn’t like normal anxiety/ depression. he still said he loved me, i mentioned it sounded like a breakup and said “do you think i’m dumb enough to break up with someone here?” and he still called me his and “his wife” (a word of endearment between us). when we were leaving i had mentioned how we needed to plan when to bring our date nights back, and plan time to talk more about how we feel in the relationship. we got back to his house (me and roommate used to switch back to her car and shower) and he broke up with me, and i asked if he thought we couldn’t work and it and he said he didn’t think so. he was also saying he was getting more aggravated with me over stupid things and i didn’t deserve that. we were supposed to talk at some point about what happened. people who know us are mixed. the roommate who is a friend to both of us has told me sometimes people just fall out of love. some family on my side think he may come back, though telling me not to count on it. (they used example from their own lives). and say how he looked at me and used to do so much for me, even in the smallest ways. they also mentioned we probably spent too much time together, which i agree with. i’m mainly heartbroken because i still love him so much, and i’m only upset at him for not even giving us a chance to work on it. our roommate already told him if we can’t live together (we would have separate bedrooms) he’s going to be the one to find a place to live. i promised my aunt, who’s been helping me and thinks he may come back (again, not counting on it but she is good with this sort of stuff weirdly) i wouldn’t reach out for 2 weeks post breakup. it’s so hard though. i see so many videos i want to send him, i struggle watching romance right now, which i used to love. i can’t watch things we used to watch together. i want to ask him why he thought we couldn’t work on it. how he went from still loving me to giving up. he was afraid i would completely change myself for him and i didn’t plan to, but i wanted to change and grow to make us work. he really felt like my person. i know we are still young and eventually it not hurt as bad, but i still feel so invested in him and his life. he had wonderful stories that i helped with designing characters, i loved his research, how he got so excited with things he loved and how he would light up and ramble on and gush about it. how he made me laugh, how he cared for me, the way his hugs felt so perfect. i’m sorry this is so long, but if you read it, thank you, and please, any experience you have is greatly appreciated ❤️",breakup,1,3683.0,687.0,7.5,0.014884979702300407,0.010825439783491205,0.10013531799729364,1.0,0.0

"got back with my ex i got back with my ex back in march after we broke up a month earlier as he had been severely neglecting our relationship for almost a year. i am talking about like only calling me twice a week, canceling dates at the last minute, not prioritizing me. we got back together a month later when he drove flowers to my apartment, which was an hour from me and apologized and told me he’d been stupid and that he would be better. he was and still is better. he calls me every night and sees me every weekend, but at least once a week he says he only has time for a “5 minute call” and then frequently lets me know he has low energy. last night when he called and i picked up i asked if he wanted to talk that night and he said “aren’t i obligated to?” made me feel kinda of crappy that my boyfriend is sometimes calling me just because he feels like he has to, but i don’t know what i expected when i originally broke up and got back together with him over phone calls and time together. he then corrected and said, “well most times i want to but sometimes i just want to relax.” i guess the thing is that i know he loves me to death, and i love him too. but i hate getting the scraps of someone’s energy, even if it’s for a valid reason like a demanding job. our anniversary is coming up, and i’m not sure how i am feeling about it or even us. he thinks i’ve been shaming him or complaining, adding pressure and not being understanding of his situation. i wish he could see how much it hurts me that he does not let me in with his emotions or life, or to have little energy for me. i don’t know what to do. to add insult to injury, i just moved out of my apartment and back in with my parents to save money for school and so now the only way we can see each other is to meet in the middle or get a hotel, as his older brother who he lives with doesn’t allow guests over. my therapist said to return the energy he gives me.",breakup,1,1938.0,400.0,4.0,0.01,0.0075,0.1175,1.0,0.0
"seeking encouragement after ending a 3+ year relationship i could use some encouragement/validation/support. i’m struggling to center myself and my feelings post-break up, instead worrying about how angry and hurt my ex is. i ended my 3+ year relationship on wednesday night with a sweet, kind, gentle man who loved me, but who could not take action on any of the promises he made me. among other things, he lied to keep the peace, telling me what i wanted to hear so i’d stick around. when we first met, i asked if he’d been tested for stds after his last partner, and he said he had and was clean. a few weeks ago, he actually admitted that he lied and wasn’t tested. can’t hold down a job due to an inflated sense of moral high ground. he financially supports and enables his burnout thief of a brother/roommate who stole from me multiple times, steals from him, never pays his share, and weaponizes incompetence (and that runs in the family…). my ex was a financial mess and still owes me money. he didn’t train or maintain hygiene for his dogs, allowing them to pee/poop in his apartment and jump on me every time i came over, despite my constant worries they’d keep injuring me with their strength and uncut nails. his version of clean? dog hair covering his place, clumps along the baseboards and layers on surfaces. “clean” dishes in the cupboard being visibly dirty when i pulled them out to use. he spent all his time at home playing board/d&d/video games and watching tv, never wanting to go out and do anything despite me asking often. all of this, and i still kept showing up. i went to his place and swallowed my anxiety and disgust. was friendly and kind to his dogs and his brother. sat in his shitty furniture that made my chronic pain flair up. gave him my body when i didn’t want to. shaved my armpits at his request. bought him so much food, weed, and tokens of love. that was one of my issues that contributed to all this: i enabled his poor behavior for far too long, and didn’t hold him accountable enough. but how many times do i have to remind him? to ask? to plead? we broke up for a week in may last year, after which he came crawling back promising change. we made lists of our needs and he enthusiastically agreed to all of mine. a year later, he admits that he was never going to train the dogs or maintain their hygiene, he was just telling me what i wanted to hear. after all this, he was surprised when i ended things on wednesday. i told him it’s because nothing has changed. i brought up my concerns plenty over the last year and tried to be patient, but it’s now getting in the way of my ability to change and grow in the ways i need to in order to be my best self. i deserve a partner who takes my wants, needs, and safety into account and actually takes action to address them. someone with ambition, responsibility, the ability to set goals and work to reach them. an adult partner. not a 40-year old manchild. he said he thinks i’m making a mistake, breaking up with him. i can’t stop thinking about how angry he is, and how much i know he’s hurting. when we broke up last year, it happened more mutually as we realized how much his dogs and cleanliness were causing issues. we had a tearful goodbye, the most loving but emotional breakup i’ve gone through. i wish this time could’ve gone that way, that we could comfort each other through this. but i know that’s unrealistic. he’s entitled to all his feelings and perception of me, but they should also no longer concern me, right? i love him. i loved him. but it’s time to let him go and focus on loving myself more… right?",breakup,1,3615.0,687.0,7.0,0.010057471264367816,0.004310344827586207,0.08764367816091954,5.0,0.0

"first relationship. just broke up hours ago. want to go back. 27m and 27f. hi, new here and reeling. broke up hours ago. maybe. a 4:30 am phone conversation. **tl;dr** **girlfriend has remarkable qualities, but i can't forge and intellectual connection with her. felt like i was i pushing into something hopeless because it was painful to breakup. but can't convince myself of that after doing it.** so i know i could still claw it back if i wanted to. i'm writing here because i don't have anyone else to vent the emotions and conflict to. just got (mostly) out of a long and very bumpy relationship. i broke up twice before, but after each time someone wanted to reconcile. after 3 months of not being together, i wrote her a long letter, every day, for over a month. i now recognize that action from me to be love bombing, but didn't realize was a negative behavior at the time. can't convince myself this is the right decision, and that i won't only regret it in the coming days and months, but continue to feel that i made the wrong decision for years and decades. though i don't believe in ""fate"" or ""the one,"" i have a hard time thinking i'll find someone with so many good and rare qualities. why break up? no negative behavior in the relationship. no yelling, no screaming, no lying, no cheating. she's kind, soft, and sweet. emotionally intelligent. oh, and stunningly beautiful. we're both catholic, both want a large family, and agree on how to spend money and raise children. check, check, check. i can hear wedding bells. but when thinking about a partner abstractly, i most strongly desire to intellectually connect. i've read my own journals from before i met her that describe that desire. i'm a math major and did some research that got published as an undergraduate. i've studied latin and read the aeneid, learned russian living in kyrgyzstan, i am absolutely in love with shakespeare. she's not from america, speaks english as a second language, and by her own admission, isn't into academics, and doesn't have strong critical thinking skills. struggles to understand how fraction multiplication works. this *constantly* lives in the forefront of my mind, and the only time i'm not thinking about it is when we're being physical. i have sincerely wished at times that i wasn't so smart. i see how it gives me a superiority complex, and how i struggle to connect with people who don't have a similar iq. i tutor a 14 year old kid in calculus who complains that he has no friends at community college because everyone there is stupid. i tell him, ""you can't just judge people by the thing you're the best at, there are so many skills out there, and you have to find the part of each person that makes them shine."" but i can't take that medicine myself somehow. i've tried. i only got my iq tested because of this issue in the relationship. cognimetrics says i'm 98.06%. that really narrows my dating pool to almost no one if i select for that. the problem is **i don't want to select for that intelligence, but i can't control my emotions and attraction around it**. i feel destined to be alone, to not meet anyone like that until i'm 40, or to settle for something smart who is lacking in other, ostensibly more important categories, like fidelity, trustworthiness, religious compatibility, financial compatibility, and physical attraction. my current (ex?) parnter has those in spades. is this a male version of girl who needs to ""settle"" for more stable guy rather than hot motorcycler with a felony that won't treat her right? do i just need to adjust my standards to realistically find someone who meets most, but not all, of my preferences? is there a way to do that? or am i pushing into a relationship that i'll never feel happy in, and end up leading us both into a joyless and mutually destructive marriage? i'm leaning toward the second, but would love some perspective from others. i'm religious and have tried prayer, and got no answers. i've tried thinking deeply about it in a non-religious way, talking with friends, and with therapists, and even my partner. none of those methods have gotten me anywhere for the year that i've felt this way. can r/breakups give any insight? thanks to anyone who read this far or even skimmed.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.018741633199464525,0.006693440428380187,0.060240963855421686,5.0,0.0

"my goodbye letter, is it okay? my dearest braeden. i am deeply sorry i messed up, i was scared. scared of how much i felt, how deeply i was falling for you, how soon i’d have to leave. so i did what people sometimes do when they’re afraid: i said things i shouldn’t have. i tried to protect myself from the pain i saw coming, and in doing that, i created a wound neither of us deserved. i said the wrong things. i made it harder than it had to be. and for that… i’m truly sorry. but please know the distance never meant i didn’t want to try. and the words i said in a moment of panic were not stronger than the feelings that bloomed every time you made me laugh, or touched my hand, or simply looked at me like i was something precious. you were, and still are, something precious to me. if i could do it all again, i would still choose you... even if it hurts. all i get to keep is the memory of our brief, beautiful summer i spent looking into your eyes. even if i was the one who made the mistake, i can’t stop aching from the silence you left behind. you vanished from my life in a way that felt like a wound i warned you about (!) one i begged you not to open. i don’t think you understand how deeply i needed you to stay. and now, i’m left facing the weight of my words, my regrets, and this cruel distance with nothing but pain. mental illness has a cruel way of making the softest things feel dangerous. and i know i carry damage, i know i’m difficult to love when i’m splitting, but i wish you had stayed long enough to see that i was trying to be better for you. i was scared... i never imagined canada would leave such a bitter taste in my mouth, i don’t think i want to set foot in this country again. when i go back to my hometown, i’m gonna train for modeling, it’s been my dream for a while but haven’t told anyone about it… and obviously, playing guitar. wherever you go, i hope you remember me not for my mistakes, but for the girl who looked into your eyes and saw the sky. the girl who would’ve given you the whole world if she could. and maybe still would. yours truly, cons.",breakup,1,2095.0,430.0,4.0,0.009302325581395349,0.002325581395348837,0.1372093023255814,1.0,0.0

"i haven’t broken up with her yet — but i know i will tomorrow, and it’s breaking me already this is hard to write, but i need to say it somewhere. i (16m) have been in an on-and-off relationship with a girl (16f) for about a year and a half. we were each other’s first real love. it started out intense and meaningful — first kisses, first holidays together, long phone calls, gifts, hoodies that smelled like each other. the kind of relationship you feel deep in your chest. but it’s also had a lot of pain. we broke up the first time mainly because i wasn’t okay with how close she was to certain guys. i’ll admit this now — i was immature and insecure. she wasn’t cheating, and i reacted like she was. i lost all trust, even when there wasn’t a reason to. i got a bit controlling because i thought i was “protecting” her, but it came from fear and jealousy. i hurt her mentally toward the end of our first run, not with words i meant to say, but just by being negative and not the person i should’ve been. eventually, she gave me a second chance. i changed. i genuinely matured. i stopped being that insecure guy and tried to grow up because i still loved her. and for a while, it felt like things were finally working. but now it’s ending — again. and this time it’s breaking me even more because i feel it’s final. she’s about to go to a motorsport college. that’s her dream — she’s passionate about racing and engineering. but the truth is, that world is male-dominated. it’s all guys. and she’s already started building connections before she’s even gone. i get it. she’s never had many close friends, and this college is everything to her. she said she needs space, time to reset, heal from stress, and build her career. she’s not doing anything wrong. she's not cheating. she’s being upfront. and i trust her. but even though i trust her, i’ve still found myself falling back into my old patterns. i’ve been constantly checking her reposts, her location, seeing who she’s messaging in the college group chat. not because she’s done anything wrong — just because i’m scared. insecure again. i know it’s toxic. i’ve tried to stop, but i can’t. and that’s not fair on her. when i first found out about her group chat full of college guys, all those insecurities hit me like a truck again. and even though she wasn’t messaging them privately or being shady, i spiraled. that was the last straw for her. she broke up with me — or at least, tried to. but we kind of fell into this weird space where we’re still technically together right now. but i’ve made up my mind. i’m going to end it tomorrow. it hurts more than anything. i ripped off the bracelet she gave me today. i deleted all our photos, even though we haven’t officially broken up yet. i changed my profile picture from a photo of us to just me. i’ve had to act dry and distant on the phone just to survive this weird limbo. i’ve cried. i still have a hoodie that smells like her, and i don’t know if i’ll ever wear it again. part of me keeps looking at her smile in old photos and thinking — why are you about to hurt someone who clearly loves you? but deep down, i know why. it’s not that she’s bad or i’m bad. we just want different things now. she wants space. i want closeness. she wants time to find herself. i want someone who’s already choosing me. and the truth is... i’ve started talking to someone else again. a girl i used to know, who’s everything i want right now. she’s loving, she’s committed, she wants me deeply and is fully ready to give everything to a relationship. my friends think she’s better for me. even my family sees the difference. but my love for my ex always clouded that. it was stronger — not better, just more intense. but now that i know i’m letting go, it’s like i can see what i really want. i just need a few weeks to heal. i’m not jumping into anything. i want to be better before i try again with someone new. i’m scared about tomorrow. i’m scared i’ll cry. i’m scared i’ll regret it. i already feel guilty, even though i know it’s right. but we can’t love each other the way we need to right now. and maybe in another life, we could’ve made it work. but not in this one. if anyone’s been through something similar — letting go even though you still love them — how did you survive the aftershock? thanks for reading.",breakup,1,3798.5,687.0,5.0,0.005780346820809248,0.006936416184971098,0.10867052023121387,2.0,0.0

"why aren’t you with you your child’s mother or father? question to those who have children only. for those who are single: what is the reason that you aren’t with your child’s mother or father? would you be tempted to break up the relationship if they were to start a new one with someone else? if so, why? if you have already broken up their relationship, what did you learn from it and gain in return? for those who are in a new relationship and currently cheating or have cheated before: what is the reason for staying with the new partner and not rebuilding the relationship with their mom or father instead? does it ever make you feel guilty/nasty at all to confuse your children with someone new involved and live a double life with their mom/dad? if you lose your new partner, will you be able to handle them leaving you? i had a situation with a 35m and 31f where he admitted he’s cheating every single relationship he’s had but for some reason can’t stay with the mother of his kids. she too has cheated on partners with him as well. he was recently served child support papers, he arrested for domestic battery a few years ago, she caused him to lose his job for other reasons. there was a point where she left her kids behind due some mental issues but later came to reclaim the children not allowing him to see them after he’s taken care of them for months on his own. they have both been physically, mentally and emotionally abusive towards each other. she has assaulted friends and family members of his as well. they are now divorced. but they continue to be in serious relationships with other people but refuse to stay together and fix what they have. i would think as a mother or father of your kids i would demand the new person out and away from our children so we could be together or have sex in peace, but they are okay with being the “side chick” and “side guy” more than they were being a wife and husband. it doesn’t make sense to me, but i was hoping someone would help me understand why this is so common nowadays. thank you in advance!",advice,0,2064.0,395.0,4.0,0.010126582278481013,0.0,0.020253164556962026,5.0,0.0

"my boyfriend just randomly stopped saying 'i love you' this week. i'm on mobile, so i apologize if the format is at all messed up. a bit of background: my boyfriend (m23) and i (f22) have been dating for 3 months, but we have been friends for over 10 years. the bulk of our relationship currently is long-distance as i am finishing up university a few states away from our hometown and he is back home working in a corporate job. he has flown out to my university to visit me, and i am flying home on monday for the holidays. we have both been talking about how much we are looking forward to seeing each other. i'll be planning to move back home after i graduate this next semester. we've been saying 'i love you' for quite a while now. he said it first, if that matters. he has met my parents, but to him it didn't really count as it was a 5-minute casual conversation as he picked me up and about a 45 minute conversation about wine another night. not too sure, but i think he is looking for a more formal 'meet-the-parents' type of deal. i was supposed to meet his parents, his twin brother, and his younger sister on tuesday for dinner and he was supposed to join for a casual family party on wednesday night, but he has since asked to raincheck wednesday (because he feels quite a bit of pressure to meet the whole family that way) and to postpone me meeting his family (as he feels it's too soon in our dating period). i said that it was fine, and that we can slow things down. i don't want him to feel pressured to do anything. he said he came to feel this way after lots of introspection. this conversation happened late last week or very early this week, i can't quite remember. up until about 2 days ago, he was still saying 'i love you'. he's been acting quite a bit off lately, but he won't go into much detail, but when i've said 'i love you' the past few days, he's completely ignored it and made no acknowledgement of it. no 'love you too', no 'i feel the same way', absolutely nothing. within the past 6 times i've said it, i've noticed total ignorance of it. i won't lie, it definitely hurts quite a bit. i've asked him if everything is okay, because i've noticed he's been off, but he just says that he has a lot on his mind. i'm hesitant to bring it up, because i don't want to make a big deal out of it, especially because i could just be making a mountain out of a molehill here. if he wanted me to stop saying that i loved him because he felt uncomfortable, i would. besides this, everything else seems to be pretty normal between us. he still texts me every day, he still calls me like normal, he still uses the same pet names for me...i'm just wondering if sometimes guys just stop saying it randomly? or rather, i guess i'm asking for advice on the best way to proceed or broach this topic with him. i know we can talk face-to-face on monday, but i wouldn't really know how to even start this conversation. thank you in advance. tl;dr: my boyfriend randomly stopped saying 'i love you' to me and i'm wondering if this is normal and also how should i approach this conversation with him?",advice,0,3112.0,594.0,3.0,0.005050505050505051,0.010101010101010102,0.06902356902356903,2.0,0.0

"he said he needed space i’m not sure why i’m writing this, but i just don’t understand what’s going on. it’s kind of ridiculous to think i’ve come to this point but i felt like i could have done more. i met my ex in the end of october on a dating app. i didn’t think much of it but we actually connected really well. soon after, we started dating and because we were long distance, i got a plane ticket and went to go stay with him for 2 weeks. that sounds like a mess too. it was impulsive and fast paced and out of character for me, but we had a good time together. towards the end of our trip he was struggling more mentally. he had trauma from a previous 2 year relationship that ended in august. i understood, and i just wanted to support him where i could. we both agreed that everything was rushed so upon returning home we agreed to separate and try to “restart” as good friends (after a month of being together). he just kept getting worse mentally and eventually stopped responding very often. that was okay, i would let him come to me when he had the energy for a conversation. at this point we weren’t together anyways. i felt like he used this time to keep to himself and stay alone in his room. he wasn’t particularly outgoing. then today, i spontaneously asked him if he wanted to play a video game with me, feeling that it may help him get out of his own head. quickly after this, he told me that he was struggling a lot and that he didn’t know what he wanted. i tried to give him reassurance that he wasn’t alone, but he proceeded to block me and many of his other friends on most social media. he unblocked me a little bit later to tell me that he would at least be safe, and that nothing was my fault. he told me he feels he needed a “fresh start” to figure himself out and heal. how am i supposed to feel about this? someone i really cared for just fell off the face of the earth. the sad part is that i understand, but i am going to miss him and i really hope he comes back, even as a friend. i really do care for him, and i’m going to wait just because i need to heal myself too. i don’t expect anything to come out of it, but i feel so lost and confused. i can’t help but hope we will talk again someday. i don’t know what to do with these feelings. i know i should take the time to focus on myself and grow, but i can’t help to worry if i will hear from him again. our times together were really good, we practically spent every hour of every day talking to each other. now he’s gone, looking for a “fresh start” without me. he blocked everyone except for his best friend as far as i know. makes sense, but this sucks. tldr: someone i really cared for disappeared edit: he also spoke a lot for me, even if it was unintentional. he said he felt like he would hurt me regardless if he stayed or left, and he jumped to conclusions about my intentions when we had a misunderstanding. it felt like he never really “heard” what i wanted to say.",advice,0,2962.0,598.0,2.0,0.0033444816053511705,0.011705685618729096,0.1020066889632107,1.0,0.0

"let a couple move in. now we want them to move out after 1.5 weeks tl;dr: my nice girlfriend invited her coworker & wife to rent the guest bed in our rent house without knowing his wife well. we felt bad for them because a tornado totaled the camper they were living in. turns out the wife is crazy & after only 1.5 weeks is making our home very uncomfortable. since they haven’t signed the lease or paid any bills or rent, how do we ask them to move out without destroying the wife’s feelings & self confidence & my girlfriend’s and her coworker’s friendship? or do we even ask them to move out? should we just make do? how would we do this around the crazy wife? basic info: me - (23 m) sally - (23 f) have been dating for 1 year & living together for 1 year. dan - (24 m) riley - (23 f) have been married 2 years. introduction: **all names have been changed** my girlfriend’s coworker, dan (24 m), lived in a camper - a disgusting, small, dirty camper with no hot water or internet - with his wife, riley (23 f). all was fine for dan & riley until a tornado recently destroyed their heater & tilted their camper. by the time he told my girlfriend this story, they had been living in this heatless, tilted camper for a week in the dead of winter (but we live in texas, so the winter hasn’t been that cold; in other words, it’s bearable). my girlfriend, sally (23 f), who is a really nice person - too nice, i think - instantly offers up our guest bedroom in the house we rent. because sally had already offered up the room, i felt obligated to give it to them before i met dan and riley; that and i also felt bad for them because they were basically living in abject poverty. now, be aware, sally barely knows riley. she really only offered the room because 1. she’s a good person, 2. she felt bad for dan, 3. dan is her genuine friend. fast forward, they move in, and we found out riley is a nut bag. after only 1.5 weeks, sally & i are incredibly uncomfortable in our own home. riley: riley is bipolar, has adhd, anxiety (she has bad, immobilizing anxiety attacks), depression, has horrible social skills, is super annoying, wants to be our best friend, and worst of all: is home 24/7; dan doesn’t want her to work because of her mental health issues (dan somehow supports both of them on his $35k salary), so she just reads, watches tv, or whatever the fuck else all day long - oh and she doesn’t do chores. she’s home 24/7. examples of riley’s bad social skills & annoying behavior: - she randomly brings up trauma in casual conversation, laughs about it, and moves on. ex. 1) after drinking a lot of water one night she says “i feel like i’m drowning myself, and as a person who actually tried to drown herself, that’s saying a lot.” ex. 2) she randomly brought up that she was raped as a kid. - she won’t stop talking to you, even if you try ending the conversation. ex.) sally had talked to riley for 10-15 minutes and tried to leave the conversation to take a shower while riley was telling a story. riley’s response? “oh, i’ll just talk faster then!” she proceeded to trap sally in the convo for another 15 minutes, making sally almost late to work. - when she’s nervous/anxious she will go on tangents and won’t let anyone else speak until her tangent is complete. and i’m talking usually looonng tangents, at lightning talking speed. - she’s a bad listener. - whenever she hears my girlfriend come out of her room she comes out a few seconds later and tries to act like she came out by coincidence. she then traps my girlfriend in conversation. - she trauma dumps on my girlfriend almost every single day. it’s like her only talking point is her vast array of mental problems. - she squeals really loud whenever she sees something she likes on tv. or when she hears crazy-ish news. or just randomly. abs just squeals a lot. dan: dan is a chill stoner. he’s not emotional, easy going, and is aware of others’ boundaries. he’s a good roommate. riley & i’s relationship: as you can probably tell, i can’t stand riley. i decided early on that i don’t want to engage with her beyond niceties. i’m a full time computer science student and most of my classes are online, so i’m stuck with riley in the house all day (my laptop is broken so i have to use my desktop). i actively avoid her by never leaving my office and never, ever strike up a conversation with her. i want to establish that we are simply acquaintances, not friends. i took this a little too far one time, though. one time when i left the house, riley says “be safe!”, which i completely ignore and don’t give a response to. as a result, riley cries hard to sally & assumes i hate her (i do, but i don’t want her to think that). hopefully this situation gives you insight to how emotionally unstable this girl is. one time i got high & hyper focused on riley’s tangent & cringed so hard i had to leave the room. dan & i’s relationship: i’ve been busy with finals the past 2 weeks, so i haven’t really gotten to spend time with dan, but i think i know him well enough. i honestly wouldn’t care if i negver saw him again in my life. i’m neutral to him. sally’s and riley’s relationship: sally doesn’t like riley either. she feels that riley sucks up her energy, annoys her, and makes her home uncomfortable. but sally is still extremely nice to riley, to a fault. sally used to work in senior care and hospice, so she knows how to treat even the worst of patients with kindness, and tends to go above and beyond in doing so. in my opinion, she treats riley like a hospice patient. and needless to say, riley thinks sally and her are close friends, which is 100% not the case. sally’s and dan’s relationship: sally and dan are genuine buds. their friendship is why dan & riley started living with us in the fist place. sally & dan work at the same place, usually during the same shift. sally & i’s opinion on riley: it feels like sally and i are babysitting someone’s kid all day. worse, an attention starved kid. for my girlfriend, it’s like a never ending slumber party with only the kid your mom made you invite. problem: riley has sucked all peace out of our home. whenever we want to leave our room, she’s there, and starts talking a mile a minute. and because she’s always at home, we can never feel at ease in our own home. proposal 1 & question 1: because dan & riley haven’t signed the lease yet and haven’t paid any bills, we want to them to move out. but how do we go about telling them this without destroying fragile riley (i think this will break her) or making sally’s work environment awkward? proposal 2 & question 2: we should just somehow make our living situation easier to live with. but how would we go about doing this?",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.008807045636509208,0.0032025620496397116,0.0632506004803843,5.0,0.0
"i don't know if i want to be friends with my bsf anymore hey everybody! a little background story, me (21f) and my best friend (20f) have been best friends since high school, and we've always been there for each other and we talked every single day. but as we both grew older, it got more difficult for me to keep up with our daily phone calls. you see, she likes to talk with me for hours on the phone everyday, usually about random stuff about her day, and of course i would tell her about my own day but it was mainly her talking since she was the chattier between the two of us. i like our phone calls, and knowing that she wants to talk with me everyday. so what's the problem? well, i got a job that is a 9 to 5 job, and even though i really like it there, i feel drained at the end of the day that all i want to do is go home, take a shower, have dinner and watch some tv before going to sleep. at first i would be able to talk to my bsf with our daily phone calls despite my exhaustion, it even got to points where i would fall asleep in middle of our calls due to how tired i was, it was more than on one occasion. a few months ago, i had a really rough week at work and i would be super tired after each day, so i ignored my bsf's calls everyday for that week, i didn't even send her a message saying why i basically ignored her, but in my defence she never messaged me either to ask what's going on. eventually the week was over and i answered her call the next day, and she asked me what was going on, and i said that i just had a rough week and was just tired. and she told me that she also had a rough week and joked that her coworkers now hate me. i asked her what she meant by that, and she told me how she told her coworkers how her bsf was ignoring her and not caring about her whatsoever. at the time, i felt like shit for not being there for her, so i just laughed uncomfortbly as she continued to joke about it and i apologized. about two weeks later, i had another rough day at work, so to avoid what happened last time, i sent her a text in advance that i was tired and wouldn't be able to talk to her on the phone that night and that i still love and care about her. she still tried to call me, but i assumed that she just didn't see my message so i ignored her calls and went to bed. i woke up the next morning to a text from my bsf, that basically said that she is tired of me not putting efforts into our friendship and that she also has a job but still manages to make time for our friendship. i got mad and wrote back that i do value our friendship and that i was just tired and it didn't have anything to do with ""making time for our friendship"". i admit, i wasn't nice in my message, and that i released some frustration on her from all the stress i had at work, but she wasn't exactly kind in her message either. i didn't get a message back and after a few hours i deleted my message out of guilt that it would hurt her, i honestly don't know if she read the message or not. fast forward to a few weeks later, this is the part i feel the most guilt about, i ignored her completely through out those weeks, i didn't answer her calls nor her texts. eventually her birthday came, and i decided that despite what happened i would still send her a birthday message, so after i finished my workday, i sent her a small text wishing her a happy birthday and that i still love and care about her. she answered, and i quote ""nice of you to remember..."" i was so upset at her response that i didn't reply and continued to ignore her. at that point, she didn't call everyday, but she did try at least a few times a week. guess what? my birthday also came after about a month, and i never got a birthday text from her, which hurt a bit but i just shrugged because what could i do? and i was the one ghosting her so i shouldn't be hurt by that. i did get a text from her a day after, asking if i wanted to attend her christmas party. my birthday was in september, she asked me three months in advance if i wanted to come to a party a day after my birthday. felt like it was her way of saying, i remembered it was your birthday, i just didn't care. i ignored that message as well. she stopped completely calling me at that point, and i was glad that she got the hint that i needed distance. i got a text from her recently asking if i ""want to fix our friendship or do i not care anymore?"". it feels wrong to continue to ghost her, but i don't know what to do at this point. what do you think should i do? tldr: my bsf thinks that me being tired from a workday and not talking to her everyday equals to me not caring about our friendship, so i decided to take a break from our friendship without telling her. should i try fixing this? or should i just break off our friendship at this point?",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,2.0,0.0020554984583761563,0.003083247687564234,0.12127440904419322,5.0,0.0

"me (26f) and my bf (26m) get along great, but his family and i aren't very compatible. need some insight. me (26f) and my boyfriend (26m, i'll call him ""charlie"") are in that in-between distance where we're not quite long-distance in the true sense, but we go to different universities for grad school and therefore don't get to see each other as often except on very specific weekends when we can and during breaks. we've been dating for 3 years now, so we're used to this and it doesn't normally cause a problem. charlie is spending christmas with his family, but they have been constantly nagging him about where i am and why i ""never come over"" for holiday events. i did visit and meet his family for the first time during two holiday events just before covid, even though this meant that i had to skip seeing my own family on those days in order to do so. that was before i started grad school, so i lived at home with my parents and they understood that i was going to meet his family. his family were all very pleasant and i was happy to meet everyone. now since i haven't seen my family in a while though, i really just want to spend time with them. we're a very small family (4 individuals) but really close to one another, so i know that they've missed me. on the opposite site, charlie comes from a very big family, and their gatherings are usually around 20 people. even though his cousin extended the invitation to their holiday events over the past couple years, i respectfully declined and explained that i wouldn't be participating in any large gatherings due to covid. i got the sense that they weren't really happy about it, but had to accept it nonetheless. covid isn't the main reason this time, so they've now been more insistent than ever and i feel like i'm being judged pretty harshly. during a recent family gathering, charlie told me that his mom and cousin started essentially gossiping about me and why i ""never come to any family holidays."" some things that were said were kind of mean and petty, in my opinion. don't they understand that i have my own family to be with on holidays too? charlie told me this out of frustration, because he wasn't happy to hear the gossip either and had to jump in to stop it. to be clear, his parents have never actually invited me anywhere, holiday or not. all the invitations came from his cousin since the events are always at his house and nowhere else. charlie actually wanted to have just the two of us and his parents together for a nice dinner sometime last year so we can get to know each other better, but his parents refused to have the dinner at their actual house because it's apparently too messy. so, we met at charlie's college apartment instead during that time, and his parents drove over an hour to get there. his parents have never actually invited me over because of their supposedly messy house, but his mom assumes that the cousin inviting me over his house for christmas counts as her invitation too because she's part of the family. charlie currently lives back home with his parents for the time being, and has even said that they would have to clean his parents' house before i would ever be invited over because of how bad it is. i'm a very clean person in general and i know that charlie has told his parents, so i think the reason is that they might feel embarrassed to have me over. he has been over my parents' house for dinner many times since i lived at home before grad school, so he knows my parents pretty well and knows that my family is also quite clean. what bothers me most is that his mom and cousin gossiped about and judged me for not coming to their holiday parties, assuming that i ""don't want to be part of their family"". when i tried to tell them that i want to spend christmas with my own family, the response they gave was that i should just bring my entire family over the cousin's house since we don't have that many people anyway. she seems to think ""the more the merrier,"" and that's not the way that my family is. his family doesn't seem to understand that i just want to spend christmas day with my own family. charlie and i have set up a different day for us and friends to go out for dinner, exchange gifts, and spend time together. this is our way of celebrating the season so we can each be with our respective families during actual christmas day. as much as i love and care for him though, i'm finding that his family and i aren't very compatible in the way we think or do things. he said that he's going to try and talk with his mom and cousin to impose some more boundaries and that gossiping about me will not be tolerated and is just going to drive me away. the two of us get along very well and he thinks more similarly to the way that i do rather than his other family members, but this whole situation has me very scared as i know there are other examples of how his some of his family members and i have not always had the same mindset. we each love our families very much as well, so i wouldn't ever want either one of us to give up our respective families. what does it mean for our relationship if his family and i just aren't compatible with each other?

"y’all please give me some insight… i’m so bummed it hurts i’ve relocated across the country… so my current social group is very very very small and i’m the only member of my family who’s never been married. i’m also the youngest (29 f) besides my cousin’s two little kids, but they aren’t relevant to my story. i want some reassurance, advise or insight. 😭 i moved across the country in march. i broke my leg and had to get it nailed back on, and then both my mom and my aunt kicked me out of their homes when i asked to convalesce there. my mom demanded to control my post-op prescriptions and i disagreed, and my aunt’s husband was verbally and emotionally abusive toward me. so that’s how i landed with my cousin (36m) and his family who i just love. but they are in a very different phase of life than me… and it makes me feel a little isolated. i started dating a guy (30m) in july around the time when i could barely start walking unassisted. it was really fun and pretty quickly he asked me to date him exclusively. flash forward to november: i took a weeklong trip back to where i had moved from to see all my closets friends just before thanksgiving. upon returning to my cousin’s house… i started to have this feeling that guy-i’m-dating was… turned off by me somehow? i couldn’t put my finger on it. i knew how busy he was between finishing his second bachelors and working full time, so i tried not to let my feelings of missing him get mixed up with this “off feeling.” also i definitely understand being busy and being unreachable. i was on active duty in the military for 10 years before i broke my leg. it’s pretty normal for me, my friends, or the people we’re dating to give a heads up that they’ll be off the grid for days, weeks, or months, at a time and we just have to wait for them to come back up on the net. however… there was 3 particular things that just gave me a bad vibe. i’m going to try to explain them objectively so maybe someone can tell me if i misinterpreted them or give me some more insight. 1) sometimes it wasn’t far out of my way to pick up a smoothie/coffee and bring to his office. some days i would call him in advance to see if he’d like anything and if he’d have time to pop out and collect a treat and so i could see him for a few minutes during this busy time. a few times he said, “that’s really nice of you but don’t do it if it’s out of your way.” this confused me a lot because we both understood it was definitely a convenient thing for me to do and that’s why i was offering… also i wanted to encourage him while he was working and see him. on one of these occasions i told him “i thought maybe this would be met with more enthusiasm… do you still want to date me?” to which he said yes. 2) when we finally got a chance to get a dinner together on a friday night, afterwards i told him “i feel like something is off, and when i don’t hear from you for days at a time, i get really spun up about it.” to which he said, “make yourself more busy so you think about it less.” 3) that weekend, i happened to be really busy, so there was not much correspondence. however, 5 days went by since we had that dinner and i didn’t hear anything from him. not a text, not a call, nothing. i couldn’t help but listen to my gut, so i drove to his office, asked to the key to his place, collected my things and dropped his off. when i made it back to his office to return the key i asked all the questions. “what happened? did you just get bored? did someone die? did your phone break? did you get hurt? did something happen i should know about?” to this he said, “no i’ve just been busy.” i said “you can say anything you want to to me” to which he just shrugged. i said, “ok. it was really fun to date you. goodbye.” since then i sent one text, saying how i was really confused that things fizzled out the way they did because i previously thought of him as a straight shooter. i also said his lack of communication hurt me because it made me feel like a play thing and not a person- like someone he just uses for entertainment when he’s bored and not so busy. and i haven’t heard a thing back. i know the text was delivered… who knows if he read it but let’s say he did… should that validate the vibe i was getting since i returned from my trip? would love any and all insight. i’m concerned i missed a signal and maybe ended something good prematurely or unnecessarily.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,4.0,0.0044943820224719105,0.0011235955056179776,0.1101123595505618,5.0,0.0
"boyfriend broke up with me because of his mom me (22f) and my boyfriend (24m) had been together for a wonderful 5 years. a few weeks ago my boyfriend decided that we shouldn't be together anymore because his mom doesn't want us to. i've only met his mom a few times and his mom never liked me much. she had apparently called me mean names to a mutual friend ""d"" of my mom and her (not knowing d is closer to my mom). this happened 3 years ago and when i brought this up with my boyfriend, he refused his mom would say such things. i trusted him because its his mom afterall and he would know her better. i still asked him to talk about our relationship with her muptiple times after that. he said that his mom would understand and that he doesnt want to put a strain on the relationship until we start planning our wedding. i only occasionally brought it up but he would just divert the topic. note that my mom isnt supportive of my relationship either (because of the name calling and other things she heard about his mom) but i had told her firmly that i'm not gonna give up this because he has been good to me all these years. me and my mom both maintain a strained but civil relationship now. so about a little more than a month ago, my boyfriend went to visit his parents for a weekend (he works in a different state- we were maintaining an ldr for 2 years because he had to move for work). when he came back from his place, he texted he wants us to not be together because he doesnt want to hurt his mom anymore. i was shattered and the following few days was me trying to tell him that we could sit down and talk about it to which he kept saying he doesnt want to continue as a couple but he still wants to be a friend. i took a break from talking to him because 1. everyone in my family had become sick and i had to take care of them 2. i was emotionally drained after trying to talk sense into him for 2 weeks. after a couple weeks, his friend contacted me saying he's in a bad place and that i need to talk with him. i called him and told him again that we could talk this through and if he still wants to break up i'll be okay with it. the reason i repeatedly wanted to talk this through was that never once have we not communicated our issues with eachother. it ends up with us trying to be better and having the issue solved. that always works because we both try to be what we promised (eg: be more understanding of eachother's schedules and arranging our own schedule so we could catch up atleast a few minutes a day). communicating would also help me understand if there is any other reason for the breakup. he refused talking together again and i got mad. i called him a chicken for not living his own life because his mom doesnt like it and that him letting opinions of others influence his life would leave him with a lot of regrets. he said that he cant do this anymore being between me and his mom. so i said i'm done and that he is now free of that dilemma and left. that was the last interaction we had (it happened about a week ago). i dont really want to break things up and i dont know what to do right now. we've been each other's confidants and best friends for all these years and it hurts me that he couldn't even tell his mom that he loves me. i'm okay with giving him a few months (i told him this and he refused this too) because he might have taken a decision in the heat of the moment. i say this because even two days before he went to meet his parents, he was his usual loving, considerate self and we ended up talking about having our wedding by the end of the next year. what do i do now? should i wait for a few more months for him to think through? should i talk to him again? is this the right decision?",advice,0,3745.0,687.0,7.0,0.009549795361527967,0.004092769440654843,0.08594815825375171,4.0,0.0

"how do i (19m) gently bring up to my girlfriend (23f) that i don't want to facetime with her every night? hey guys. so recently, i haven't been enjoying talking on the phone with my girlfriend as much as usual. i still enjoy it at times, but sometimes it feels like a chore (for lack of a better word) and i like quiet nights to myself sometimes when she has other things going on or she's tired. ultimately, she doesn't have a lot of people to talk to (neither do i, but she's a far more social creature than me), so i get a lot of it. at the beginning of our relationship, i loved that. but as we get further in and the honeymoon stage is over, i need my space too. anyways, as a result i've started to dread facetiming her at nights sometimes. it's driven me into multiple tailspins that maybe i don't love her anymore or something is wrong, but truthfully it's just because we do it too often. when we hang out in person, it's the best time. i first thought it's just because face to face time is always better, but as i thought about it more, it's because we don't do it every day. problem is, she sees no problem. she would call me multiple times a day and hang out with me every day in an ideal world. would she maybe get sick of it after awhile, yes, but that isn't the point. we just have different ideas of what constitutes the right amount of time to spend together, and have different needs. and that's started to expand to phone time. she's having a hard time with the holidays here for some personal reasons so i feel bad wanting to bring this up to her and take her away from time that makes her happy, but i also don't want to sacrifice my own enjoyment in this relationship. and i don't want to never talk to her on the phone, i just ideally would want to facetime maybe 3-4 times a week instead of every day. i just don't know how she'd take that with everything else in mind, and like i said, it is a serious disruption of our norm. do i bring it up now, leave it alone for until after the holidays (two weeks from now essentially), or see if anything just changes on its own? i don't know. the night time has just always been ""our time"" because she sleeps much later in the mornings (or we're in school), my afternoons (and often hers too) are busy, and it leaves is the night as ""our time"". but sometimes i want it to be my time too. is there some kind of compromise i could reach?",advice,0,2402.0,466.0,2.0,0.004291845493562232,0.012875536480686695,0.08798283261802575,3.0,0.0

"i need help confronting my roommate’s disgusting habits before i put a formal complaint in i (21 f) have three roomates (22 f emily, 19 f rey, and 19 f rose all fake names) but i am mainly only talking about emily’s and rey since they both have cats. we were all assigned to an off campus apartment and just met each other in august. emily had 2 cats already when we moved in, i brought my one and rey ended up taking one in we found in the parking lot in the cold in october. all was well for a while emily’s room stunk here and there but i didn’t say anything because we all had a really busy and stressful semester where we all weren’t at the apartment at the same time. problems started arising after rey took in the kitten we found. the kitten originally belonged to someone in the apartment complex that told us she no longer wanted the kitten (ok asshole don’t abandon it outside though). rey felt “bonded” to the kitten for 3 days and decided to keep her but after realizing the tasks and upkeep that comes with she slowly changed her tune. she began closing her door keeping the kitten from being able to go in her room so it was constantly eating all mine and emily’s cat food while also not being properly potty trained so having accidents in our rooms. this went on for about a month where we had enough of the costs we were putting in to take care of her kitten so we had an intervention with her. rey agreed to leave her door open and to take into consideration our suggestions on how properly care for a kitten. that went well for maybe 3 days before the smell became noticeable. it seeped into the living room and anytime me and emily hang out there we are constantly hit with the putrid smell of cat pee and poop. meanwhile emily’s room is also giving off a similar scent to which she must be nose blind to. i find myself wanting to barf the second i walk in to the apartment because it’s so bad. i have had cats my whole life and consider myself to be a good owner. i scoop the items out of the litter box when i wake up and get home every night, place food out at every meal, replace the water dish everyday, give treats and cuddles you name it. however i guess this is not normal to scoop cats litter daily?? i investigated their rooms since i am looking after the cats while they are away during christmas break and found their litter boxes over flowing with poop and pee to the point the cats have done it on the floor next to the box. i am disgusted and horrified by what i saw and am so angry they could let their cats use those boxes. i have been thinking about putting in a formal complaint to the front office because it smells horrible and they don’t deserve their cats if they will continue to treat them this way. however i’d like to do a similar intervention to talk to them about the smell before i make a complaint but i dont know how to bring it up without sounding like an entitled karen who knows what’s best for cats. this is a serious issue and i don’t want to do it over text but i hate confrontation.. any help would be appreciated greatly tldr: roomates aren’t cleaning up their cat’s litter box it is stinking up the whole apartment how do i confront bthem without coming off as insulting?",advice,0,3231.0,627.0,3.0,0.004784688995215311,0.003189792663476874,0.06539074960127592,3.0,0.0
"i (24f) am part of an unwanted love triangle with my supervisor (24f) and coworker (35m) i (24f) have been having problems with a few co-workers (23f, 35m) at my job. one is my supervisor, another is a employee who is a 35 year old male. to start off, when i first started working at this particular job, i had a strange feeling about my male co-worker. he was extra nice and everyone liked him. i caught him creeping on me a couple of times and he also gave me weird vibes whenever i was around him. one night he was particularly flirting with me and i thought ""hey this guy is actually nice, he's asking a lot of questions about myself"". then one day one of my other co-workers and i were talking and she told me that the male co-worker and her were sleeping with each other and had some sort of relation with one another. i was surprised because he is about 15 years older than her. he started flirting with me intensely. he was always around me and always being extra nice to me. he's very experienced at the job and so i would always go to him for help as well. one day my co-worker who told me that this particular guy and her were having a relation with another told me he was a jerk. she confirmed that he was married and had a child, in which he never told her about. she was also convinced that he was having a relationship with another young girl at my job (lets call her kali) i ignored her because she was saying a lot of things and she was very emotional. i couldn't have the conversations she was trying to have with me in the workplace, but i tried to be supportive. she ended up having a lot of mental issues and went to one of the managers and explained the situation. she almost got him fired, and the guy told my managers that he was getting a divorce from his wife. i still kind of liked him after all of that because he was very charming and attractive. he went on leave. he ended coming back about 6 months ago. he pursued me even harder. sometimes getting inches away from me. people who were around thought that he was my husband, or incited that we were ""together"". he would say side comments, and it felt sexual. at times i really did feel uncomfortable because i felt like i had no choice to not be flirty because of just how close he got to me and the questions he would ask. the ""kali"" girl is my supervisor. all of the sudden they started to spend alot of time together. everyone continued to have their suspicions about the two of them. during this time he still flirted with me, just not when she was there. i started to notice this pattern and started to see the situation for what it was. the worst part of this situation is that my supervisor (kali) who was my co-worker isn't treating me like she used to. she micromanages what i do and it seems that everything i do is wrong. every time she is in front of him or when he is there she'll either talk down to me or be super nice to me which i find weird. and if he sees me he'll treat me like he has never done before. he'll either say something to get under my skin, or he'll be cold to me. which i don't really care about. i would much rather have him treat me like another person than to flirt with me. another bad part is that whenever my supervisor is not around he'll find me in the workplace and almost ""stalk"" me, trying to get my attention. he'll get very close to me, or walk past me alot. i honestly feel very scared in this situation because there is so much tension. i have been trying to ignore him and not engage with him at all. . i don't know why my supervisor is acting like this.. if it's because the male co-worker and her have a thing going or if its because shes new to management. it's strange because she also has been more aggressive towards me ever since i stopped engaging with my male co-worker. today i had enough of it and got upset and talked to two of my other co-workers about it. i don't want to be apart of it, and i'm getting a lot of ill feelings and dissonance from this situation. my other co-workers tell me to talk to a manager, but how do i even explain. i don't want to get anyone fired and i also don't want anyone to think that i'm making this up in my head. i could be, but it feels to real in my instincts. i don't know what to do, but i just want my supervisor to treat me well again and for my male co- worker to give me space and not be around me all the time when my supervisor is not there. is this a situation that anyone else experienced? tldr: somehow i feel like i am part of love triangle at my job that i don't even want to be part of and i am getting reprehended for it from my own supervisor because the guy is a known jerk.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,3.0,0.0032537960954446853,0.0032537960954446853,0.1052060737527115,1.0,0.0

"long time marriage - is it abusive? this is a close friend of mine. i want to help her, so i am writing here to see what your opinion is: hubby 47, wife 47, married 27 years. hubby has a history of a bad temper. it's not often. usually once a year but when it happens, it is horrible. the most recent was because wife was upset at him for leaving the kids at at a very important work event of wife until 9pm. he could've gone home anytime. he pressured her to leave, and she snapped saying he could go at any time. they had two cars, they lived a mile away from the event. the kids were passed out asleep and she didn't appreciate him keeping there the entire time. he lost it. she left with hubby, but he was pissed. first, he refused to drive the vehicle because he wanted to argue. wife was tired, very and just wanted to go home. she asked him to go home, he refused. she got out of vehicle and walked back to closed building. he pulled vehicle in the front, stayed park. she knew he wouldn't leave until she came to vehicle. the kids were in the back seat (they are four and five years old). so she got in the vehicle. on the way home, she didn't say a word to him but he ranted. she told him that he was ramping himself up and to please stop. he got worse. they got home, he said he would give his kids a shower and for her to leave the house. she began to leave until he turned to one of the kids and said momma is leaving because she doesn't care about you. so wife has to stay - what else is she going to do? she is so tired, she isn't saying anything or fighting. he gets up in her face and tells her what a bitch and other words. he pushes her toward the wall. she holds up her hands and says ""i'm not touching you"" he backs off, and then he walks passed her, using his shoulder to push her again. wife walks out with hubby to the car outside, she opens the passenger door to ask him not to leave, he tells her to f - off. peels out of the driveway damaging the grass and leaving skid marks in the driveway, it's so violent, the passenger door shuts on its own. he is gone for the night. a charge of $150 of a local hotel appears on their bank account. the next day, wife has to work and is thankful their son is home to babysit the kids because hubby is still not home. she goes and gets donuts and returns home to find hubby has returned but is no where to be seen. wife drops of donuts and goes to work another 12 hour shift. at 7pm, son shows up with box of cold pizza leftovers. he is about to leave but says that they are going to walk around a minute during the event. wife has a break, so she wanted to go with the kids. hubby is cold and distant. afterward, wife returns to work. when wife gets home, hubby is on the couch. not a word. he is flying out of town in the morning. wife is supposed to take him to the airport an hour away, leaving at 4am. it's midnight when she goes to bed, but doesn't sleep well due to the early morning departure. hubby gets up, takes a shower, and doesn't say anything. wife asks if he still needs a ride. he says no, he has a ride. hubby leaves. wife has to find out if kids are going to church with grandma (his mother) in the morning. she texts grandma to find out that hubby was told to tell wife that there is church. he said nothing. wife later gets in vehicle to find engine codes popping. hubby didn't tell her about that either. hubby left the living room and kitchen looking like a frat party happened the night before - it took two days to clean it. hubby texts ""landed in xyz"" and for two weeks, texts things like that. wife doesn't respond. finally, a week before hubby is due home for christmas, wife writes and says that she feels disrespected, unloved, and doesn't know what to do. hubby says he was ""attacked"" by wife. she twist everything to make him the bad guy. he left because wife needed space. he never said anything ugly to the girls. he got a car and slept on the couch because he didn't want to bother wife after working long hours. the house is always a mess and they need to fix that. he said he perceived is a bully because he is a big guy (he is 6'5"", 290lbs). didn't matter that he is actually physical. (wife is 5'7"" 140 pounds) he says that wife is always playing the victim, that wife is the abuser. that she always attacks him with her words and even is attacking him by the messaging that she feels disrespected. he put out the olive branch with the cold leftover pizza and invited wife to go walking with them. (note, he never invited her anywhere, she just decided to go) she had been in her office, he had been outside, sent son in to give her pizza. he said that he assumed wife knew about the codes so need to tell her about them. (note: hubby knows a lot about cars and usually fixes them). important to note. hubby never picked up the phone to call, not even once. when wife pointed this out he said ""he hates phone calling for something that can be texted."" he now says he isn't coming home for christmas because he is done with being treated poorly. wife said it was another punishment but he put ""lol. you. punished. enjoy your perfect life."" wife says, most of the time hubby is sweet, caring, and loving. he works hard and provides for the family well. he is a loving father. but this has happened at least 30 times in their marriage, i keep telling her it is abusive and she needs to leave him, but she doesn't believe me. what do you think?",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.016098484848484848,0.0,0.004734848484848485,3.0,0.0

"do i leave this relationship to better myself or am i being dramatic?? (f,20) been with my partner (m,21) about 2.5 years (my first relationship & sexual partner). we lived about 1.5hrs apartment, no cars, so we would book hotels to spend time together. we’ve had issues escalating to physical violence throughout our relationship (still argue quite a bit, basically everyday). at the start, i was working and absolutely loved my job, i went out with friends and family regularly and maintained good relationships with them, gym regularly. basically i was extremely happy with my life considering after struggling myself i was finally headed in the right direction. he was honest and wasn’t in the best place (wasn’t working, mental health, previous addiction)… i knew what it felt like to be alone, after coming out of depression again so i was always supportive however i could be. at times he would rely on me too much (having to juggle family responsibilities, work, uni, caring for mother and social life) making me pull away. then it leads to a fight because i’m not “there for him” or “unsupportive” additional info: i have a low sex drive, (slightly concerning 😂), insecure, he wants to have sex everyday! and pretty much demands it (“it’s your duty to please your man”, “just play with it” or he’ll just keep pressing himself against me (if i’m not in the mood, yuck!) which has caused a lot of fights and i can understand being turned down can hurt especially repetitively. i have definitely just done it for him sometimes bc of feeling guilty about not having a higher sex drive or not meeting his needs. now i’m over it and no means no, idc how much your balls hurt!! outings: i experience a little anxiety, he says his is severe anxiety and in the past he gets very easily irritated by anyone and almost anything which makes dates hard!!, we can’t have a good time. he walks ahead of me and says i walk so slow, i always feel like he’ll find a way to end the date (start a fight, drag his feet, yawn or just complain!). when i vocalise these things he says it’s to cope with his anxiety?? sounds like lies but he’ll breakdown and almost cry sometimes so i think i’m being unsupportive now: fast forward —>> through to; various ups & downs, fights, almost-break ups. he’s got his own place(which is great but basically wants me to live here) there’s been a lot of animosity between us, when we fight we just sit in separate rooms, we haven’t been out on a nice date in so long, spend most of our time high, he’ll play xbox while i just sit on my phone and exist around him. i always make suggestions for dates but i don’t see any enthusiasm so i’ve slowed down. most days i rarely leave his place and sit here thinking about everything else that i could be doing. he’s started a new job and wants to follow a “traditional” role, essentially wants me to stay home and take care of the place (cleaning, shopping etc.) he says he’s happy to provide for both of us but i don’t think that’s fair on him and unrealistic especially because everyone has their own financial goals and i just can’t expect everything from him (unreliable). he enjoys having power/control and will always say things like (“you’re in my place, “who’s paying/paid for it”) & will make sly comments implying that he’s doing better than me. (“at least i’m making some money, not sitting around all day”). he act like i’m his child, says he’s the man “who’s got the dick and balls” *while grabbing his crotch* 💀 biggest ick in my lifee and they absolutely get to me. i’ve always felt like i was being held down by the relationship. - fighting and missing work, family/friends events. - he always wanted to see me even days where i’m flat out busy he says why can’t you see me after and claim i’m not putting effort into the relationship. - i’d be out having fun with friends, he’d always be suspicious of cheating especially if i missed a call/text i knew they’d be a fight the next day… started going out less - he’s always had issues with me going out with friends (sometimes i’ll forget to message him and he gets upset)(i’ve reassured him 100x about cheating etc.) - always wants me over. doesn’t respect/understand the responsibility i have with my family (immigrant parents and sick parent) - he’s sexist and misogynistic, very shocking because his mum is super sweet, he always seems to always talk about how women “should & shouldn’t act”, he says when men cheat it’s just sex? - says i’m trying to compete with him ever since he got a job?? not like i just want to make myself and family proud everyone around me is getting so impatient and have expressed their concerns about the relationship holding me back and have witnessed some of the toxic behaviour. especially after arguing i feel so defeated and i can’t be myself for the people around me (missing special event, not being available etc.) i’m really afraid to lose, my support system because i’m trying to make the relationship work. obviously i really love him but he doesn’t seem to care about my needs in life, i just feel like he only wants me for him. whats your advice im so stuck???",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,6.0,0.0062047569803516025,0.005170630816959669,0.0889348500517063,5.0,0.0

"at my college graduation today, i met a girl i really liked and didn't get the chance to ask her out before the graduation ceremony, they had us sit in this auditorium after we checked in, and placed us in a specific order so that when we would walk to the area where the ceremony was we would be in that same order for logistical reasons. i got sat next to this girl, among other people of course, but to start conversation i asked her what her major was, what classes she took etc etc, and she seemed really interested and would ask me about myself. it's hard to describe but it felt we really displayed interest in each other, she would laugh at everything slightly funny i said, and damn she was beautiful, but not like out of my league. she had gorgeous eyes and was really easy to connect with. after sitting next to her and talking for i think was like 3 hours, i tried to muster the courage to ask her for her number, snapchat or something, but i wanted to wait until after the ceremony. after it ended, it was a bit chaotic and loud as everyone was trying to get up in the stands to meet their family, take pics etc etc. in the heat of the moment i thought ""now's not a good time"" and told her it was nice meeting her and wished her luck in her job search, and she said something similar and we parted ways. idiot me should have considered that, despite the chaos, this was the only time. i feel like i missed a big opportunity. even if it was an opportunity to just be friends, i really wanted to know her better but the circumstances were against us. i have been thinking all day about how i have been single for a couple years, how so many problems in my life are lack of confidence, self esteem, and fear of rejection, which is why i have been single for about 2 years now. i want to reconnect with her, maybe not necessarily ask her out, but maybe to start as friends, but the only way i could do that is through email, because for our school emails all you need to do is type their name in. i have no other way of contacting her, i don't have her number or snap or anything. would i be overstepping, perhaps being a creep by emailing her something like ""hey it's me ____ from graduation earlier. i enjoyed talking with you today, it made commencement a bit more bareable. if you're ever in [my town] again soon, and want to hang out (?) here's my number"" please let me know, if i'm nuts for thinking about doing this, or if i should let it go and move on. i really am leaning towards trying to be someone different for once and actually message her. thank you for reading.",advice,0,2587.0,495.0,1.0,0.00202020202020202,0.00404040404040404,0.08282828282828283,1.0,0.0
"my friend's boyfriend has suicidal thoughts and refuses help. what else can she do? hello everyone, i apologize for the throwaway account. my friend (f34) has been in a relationship with her bf (m32) for a little less than a year, and they are deeply in love. they share good communication, affection, and lifestyle, seemingly a great couple. that is, at least, until last month. her bf progressively began to feel more distant and to exhibit signs of depression: losing interest in what he does, staring in the void for minutes, avoiding physical contact, no interest in sex, spending lots of time alone, eats and showers scarcely, and other very unusual behaviours. noticing this, my friend tried to tackle these changes with him several times, but he didn't open up. rather, he either stays silent, or he becomes increasingly irritated and claims that ""nothing's wrong"". after some time, my friend managed to get a response like: ""these are my problems, you don't have to help me"". my friend did her best to be understandable and leave him space to process his situation, while being willing and ready to help if asked. however, the contact got scarcer over time, and after a while he wrote her a message claiming that ""he is not ready for a relationship"". she was heartbroken, but she feels that this could be due to what he is going through, rather than a decision taken with a clear mind. he hides these behaviors from family and colleagues. my friend tried to reach out to his friends and his brother, concerned for his wellbeing. some shared her concerns and agreed to keep an eye on him, others claimed that ""he looks normal to them"". in doing this she discovered that his best friends have been cut off apparently for futile reasons. recently, he started posting enigmatic thoughts on social media (which he rarely used before). alarmingly, a couple of these contained references to hanging. my friend is obviously very concerned, but she doesn't know what else she can do. he seems to be aware he has issues, but he denies them to others and likely himself too. from their past talks, she thinks his problems are rooted in some troubled relationships with his family. for this reason she is not sure whether talking the situation with his dad or mom could make things better or worse. is there something else my friend can do to help her bf? or is this really all she can do? thanks to anyone helping us thinking through this! tldr: my friend's (f34) boyfriend (m32) is most likely suffering from depression and recently posted possibly suicidal thoughts. she tried to help him the best she can, from talking with him about it to involving his close friends and a family member, but he refuses all help. what else can she do?",advice,0,2736.0,478.0,5.0,0.010460251046025104,0.006276150627615063,0.027196652719665274,4.0,0.0

(tldr: boyfriend's lack of poop hygiene has killed my attraction for him. previous attempts to address this seemed like they worked, but the poo stains are back. asking for advice on how to clearly set my boundary while hopefully minimizing his embarrassment and defensive response.) my boyfriend (late 20s m) and i (mid 20s f) have been together collectively for almost 4 years. we were together for 3 years when i broke things off, largely due to the aforementioned issue of buttcrack hygiene in the title. i adore him, and i understand that most people have some minor areas in their hygiene they could improve on, but this was a deal breaker for me. when i first noticed the issue, i tried calmly and kindly talking to him about it, but he would become a little defensive and incredibly hurt. the bumcrack issues would get a little better for a week, then come back full force. there was also the issue where he wouldn't wash his hands after pooping, and his hands will smell like they touched crap. i dreaded the thought of being intimate with him because i hate the crack-shaped poo stains and smelling what he had cooking in-between his cheeks the instant he took off his pants. i flinched when he touched me because i wondered if he was getting poop particles on me. needless to say, i was no longer attracted to him and he didn't seem to be motivated enough to be more hygienic for me. we broke it off. after more than a year apart, we came back together, discussed our issues and started dating again. besides this bum dilemma, we work really well together and have great chemistry and mutual love. it really seemed like his hygiene had improved, and i was happy and secure in our relationship again for several months. ...fast forward to now, being back together nearly a year. the poop issues are back. guys, i've *nearly* tried everything. i've left wet wipes for him in the bathroom. i've refilled his hands-soap when he runs out and hasn't refilled it. i offered to buy him a bidet. i tried to educate him that the water running over his bum in the shower does not actually clean the poop off. he's not getting the hint. because he's been defensive and was so hurt in the past when i bring this up, i've been putting off having another direct conversation with him. but i need to put my foot down and tell him i cannot be with him if he smells like poop all the time and leaves poop marks on the bed. i can't keep going like this, and it's unfair to him for me to just not be avoiding sex with him without explaining to him that his lack of hygiene grosses me tf out. besides the bum issues, he really is a wonderful man. he's kind, funny, and caring. i really need advice and support for how to initiate this conversation in a way that will minimize his embarrassment and pain while still making sure i'm setting a definite boundary. if we break up, we break up... but i'd rather be as kind about it as possible.",advice,0,2996.0,550.0,6.0,0.01090909090909091,0.005454545454545455,0.06909090909090909,1.0,0.0

"partner with bdp cheated on me hey there everyone, i could really really use some advice, i (m23) myself don't have bpd, but my partner (f24) does, we are in a long distance relationship which has its trials but we feel in our hearts that we are meant to be and have been able to overcome a lot to get here, i truly love her, and she loves me, but last night she revealed to me that she gave oral on her birthday after clubbing and spent the night at his house, this was 4 months ago... obviously this broke me, and i feel sick to my core but i don't hate her at all for this, i know there is so much that is involved with bpd that it's not cut and dry. at this point while not in a relationship we had expressed our love and commitment to each other and has been talking for a year, and the only thing we were waiting on was to see each other so we could say the words in person to each other, this changed in october because our love for each other just grew bigger than the wait was worth which means that we went into our relationship with the secret happening just a month prior... i know that she has her battles that she is constantly going through which is why i have so much respect for her, but i just don't understand why this has happened, i am an insecure person at my core but constantly grow myself to be secure, which a lot of that was also spurred out of inspiration for her, i want to be her rock, this is all to say my insecuritie have caused me to break things off people who have done this to me in the past but the way she was talking, the way she was apologizing it does feel like she was sincere. another issue is... i just don't know how much of the truth it is, i don't know if it would have stopped there, she mentioned some of the thoughts that she had where she allowed herself to do it since it was her birthday, and if she kept the secret it was okay, and that the alcohol was involved, but then apparently only did oral and didn't go further because of us... it just seems like two radically different thoughts which makes me doubt the story and i don't want that lack of faith to be plaguing me. but i don't want to be walking around with blinders on. i know everyone is different, but i think i am just looking for stories and situautions people have gone through with their partners, how they overcame it and how the person experiencing bdp was feeling during/afterwards that drove them to that, anything would help, even some general advice, don't want to judge, and please don't judge her for it. i want to move past this badly in the most mindful way for both of us if you are more comfortable dming me because you don't wanna share your experience with everyone, please feel free to as well, any sort of help",advice,0,2747.0,535.0,2.0,0.003738317757009346,0.003738317757009346,0.08411214953271028,0.0,0.0

"dealing with getting kicked out of the friend group this story is pretty twisted, so if u don’t manage to keep up, i don’t blame u at all. i (20f) have recently been pretty much kicked out of my friend group. just like that. no warning, no reason, no explanation. i felt it coming somehow. when it was my birthday, almost no one wanted to come. they all made different excuses, some of which i later found weren’t even true. some of them didn’t even wish me a happy bday. then again they excluded me from every occasion where they were all gathered together to hang out. they also didn’t invite my boyfriend, my girl best friend and my boy best friend. we were all a part of the same friend group before. the only gathering they did invite me on, i later found out they were talking behind my back and basically regretting they even asked me to come. after a while i found out that they had made another group chat without us in it. today was one of the boys’ birthdays and i congratulated him. it just seemed rude not to. now i see that he is actually currently having a birthday party. wasn’t invited. again. however, my boy best friend (who talked shit about the boy whose birthday it is) did get invited, even though he literally just talked so badly about this boy and is now acting like nothing happened. he is hugging the same girl he called a wh**e cause she was one of the people who apparently initialized getting us kicked out. i feel so alone. i feel so betrayed. it just sucks so much. i literally did nothing to them, i’m not the type of person to fight or make drama, so this type of thing is really new to me. i just feel so awful. they were my only close friends. and i wanna say f them, screw it etc, but we were friends for a long time and i genuinely never had better friends. we used to take trips together, knew each other’s families and went to each other’s houses. i feel like this is all so toxic, like why would they just cut me out, just like that? what is your take on all this?",advice,0,2006.0,396.0,4.0,0.010101010101010102,0.0025252525252525255,0.08838383838383838,2.0,0.0
"my [23m] best friend and longtime crush [23f] says she'd be my girlfriend if i wanted. however, she is polyamorous and would continue to date her current boyfriend [21m], who is cool with this. she's been my best friend since high school, and we've been undergoing a major change in our relationship in the last several weeks. i have a lot of mixed feelings about this, despite it in many ways being what i've wanted for years. we have a pretty long history of feelings being involved in our friendship, and i'm gonna try to be concise here. she actually liked me first, back when we were in high school, but i kept turning down her advances while she ended up in a string of mostly shitty relationships. and she would sometimes invite me over to her place to cuddle with her. over time, i pretty clearly started liking her back, but for various personal reasons i was still uncomfortable with the idea of dating her. she became single around when we started college, her feelings for me grew even stronger, and finally i stopped kidding myself and asked her if she wanted to date. she happily said yes, and it seemed like everything was set-- but then a day later she told me she'd realized she's a lesbian. i never entirely got over that whiplash, but after a little while i believed her, despite the massive crush on me she'd had for a couple years. several years passed-- she kept dating people on and off, sometimes more than one at the same time. (consensually, of course. she's been polyamorous for a long time.) i'd still occasionally cuddle with her, and there were moments when she flirted with me (this was in the depth of the pandemic and she didn't have the outlets she usually did) and she even basically pity-fucked me at one point. but for the most part, she wasn't interested in me. my feelings for her were very off-and-on at that point, but basically whenever i didn't have anything going on in my dating life i'd find myself pining pretty heavily for her. and she knew that. we've always been very honest with each other, which is one of the reasons i like her so much-- i even told her i loved her romantically, at one point, and that hardly put a dent in our friendship. weeks ago, she told me she'd been thinking about her sexuality again and that she's realized she's bisexual. i may have gotten my hopes up, but i never expected her to be making out with me on my bed a couple days later, enthusiastically talking about how much she wants me. once again, i told her i love her, and she said she loves me back. and god *damn* if that wasn't cathartic. she said she'd be my girlfriend, if i wanted. but i knew it couldn't be that simple. she's been dating this boy for almost two years now, and they've been living together for over a year. i'd long noted the irony of my lesbian crush dating a boy, but sexuality is fluid and he's very androgynous anyway. i've never really had a conversation with him, but unlike her past relationships he really seems like a decent guy. my friend is on record as this being the best relationship she's ever had. i've always been kind of awkward around him, which i'm sure is an obvious tell to him that i'm jealous, but apparently he approves of me. i'm just so confused by this situation. she's always been polyamorous-- she said she felt compelled to love multiple people, and i can't change that. i don't care about her having sex with other people; that's not ideal for me but i'd gladly accept that as the cost of dating my best friend. but i really don't like the idea of effectively playing second fiddle to her boyfriend. i've always struggled with feeling like i'm neglected by my peers, and for a relationship i want to be someone's first choice, you know? i feel like i don't deserve anything less than that. and my friend's aware of that-- like i said, i really can talk to her about anything. that's why i love her. but that means, on the other hand, how the hell can i ever date anyone who's not my beautiful, sarcastic best friend who understands me better than anyone else? she's the most important person in my life besides my parents. i've always struggled at making friends, and though i've had some close calls over the years i've never been in a legitimate relationship with anyone. i hate feeling like i'm so much more reliant on her than she is on me, but no matter what happens, cutting her out of my life isn't an option. but that only makes me worry about my future prospects with others! even when she was a lesbian, i dreaded the thought that i might be asked, ""if your best friend told you she'd date you, would you dump me?"" and i don't think i'd have a good answer for that question. and that was back then, not now, when we've been having sex and declaring our love for each other every time i come over to her place. she wants me to take her out on a ""serious"" date, and the only reason i haven't done it yet is mostly that i've been busy with schoolwork. all i know is, if i were dating me, i'd see this situation as a *massive* red flag. but the prospect of getting over her, while knowing she likes me back, because our feelings aren't *one hundred percent the same* seems basically impossible. i always knew i'd have to get over her to date someone else, but that seemed a lot easier when i didn't think she liked me back. so i feel stuck in this limbo, where i'm not quite dating my best friend because my feelings like i deserve better are strong enough to keep me from taking things all the way (the term she's using is that we're ""seeing"" each other). but i'm in too far deep to date anyone else. how do i get out of this knot? thanks for reading all that. **tl;dr:** i'm in love with my best friend, who likes me back but is polyamorous and dating someone else. i don't want to be her ""other"" boyfriend, but i like her too much to get over her while knowing she likes me back.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,1.0,0.0009099181073703367,0.010009099181073703,0.08826205641492266,4.0,0.0

"very poor relationship between sibling (20) and me (18m). found their reddit account with extremely troubling posts, how should i ask them about it? possible trigger warning: >!physical abuse, rape, csam!< so my (18m) relationship with my sibling (20) is not close at all, and a large part of that is my own fault. i was too immature to understand when they started having more mental health issues, and i just never reconnected with them after we drifted apart. i don't even know what gender or name i should use to describe them so i will use they/them for this post. they present themselves as female and use their name given at birth in front of family, both immediate and extended, but they present as male and use a different name outside of that. i am aware of this and i have mentioned it to them that i am supportive of any decisions they make regarding their identity though i am unsure if they believed me. i used to be pretty outspokenly homophobic and transphobic so this would be completely understandable. it is worth noting that as far as i know, our parents are unaware of this, and the relationship between parents and sibling is more negative and strained, but not terrible, or so i thought. i knew my sibling's reddit account for a while, but i never looked through their history until now, because i don't think they are aware that i know it and it seemed like a violation of privacy. i looked for it recently, because i was wondering what pronouns they were using and what name they were going by (i am a pretty shitty sibling, i know). the posts i found are extremely disturbing and saddening, partly because i know that they don't share such information with me or the family but also because of the content. i won't delve into much detail but their posts divulge information about our parents that would probably lead me to go very low-contact or no-contact with them immediately (physical, verbal, psychological abuse, csam, possibly sexual abuse?). but i need to talk with my sibling before i make a decision like that, which is difficult to bring up because of our very distant relationship. there are also lots of posts about some mental health, addiction, and sa/rape problems my sibling has had that i want to let them know i will talk with them about if they want, but again, my relationship with them isn't close enough to warrant that. we are having a large family get-together for christmas, but i don't want to ask my sibling about it them, since they will be away from any support groups and probably be in a very high-stress situation being surrounded by family. how should i go about letting my sibling know that i saw their reddit posts and need to talk about it asap even though i almost never talk to them normally?",advice,0,2757.0,497.0,3.0,0.006036217303822937,0.0,0.1006036217303823,3.0,0.0

"how long should i (22f) wait for him (22m) to reach out? i (22f) took a science course this past fall semester, and developed a bit of a crush on my lab instructor/ta (22m). we had some interesting things in common, and i really found him endearing and enjoyed being around him. i thought he warmed up to me as well, but he’s a little hard to read. imo, honestly, his manners need work since he can be kind of brusque and standoffish, but he’s also the reserved/nerdy type (translation: slightly socially awkward) which is right up my alley so maybe it comes with the territory? anyway, at the end of the semester (which was almost 2 weeks ago), i actually gave him a holiday card with a thank-you note written in it; i basically said that spending time with him was a highlight of my semester, and i’d love to stay in touch and hopefully get to know him better outside the classroom. left my number as well. so, how long should i wait for him to reach out? finals ended on friday dec. 16, and although i obviously don’t know his winter break plans in detail, i do know that he is traveling and may be busy until the new year (like most people). but…i’m also worried about setting myself up for further disappointment and confusion. after all, it doesn’t take that long to send a text just to let me know it’s a yes from him—unless it’s not. maybe i misinterpreted his friendliness and the brusque attitude i picked up on was actually disinterest, and if he hasn’t reached out, it’s because he doesn’t feel like it. if i never get a message from him, this is obviously inconsequential, but if it ever does happen, how long is too long? because i also don’t want any connections in my life, friendship or otherwise, with people that feel lukewarm towards me and treat me like an afterthought. there’s also the issue of him having been my instructor, and even though the fall term is over (which should make this a non-issue), there’s the question of optics. he’s a first year graduate student from out of state, and reputation is very important in academia; even though pursuing a friendship or relationship with a former student may technically be above board, it may not look wonderful. so i’m torn between giving him extra time to reach out, due to the nature of the situation and the fact that he may just genuinely be busy (also doesn’t know me very well yet so it makes a bit of sense that this isn’t #1 on his to-do list), or disqualifying him after a certain period of time passes without contact. i’d love some feedback on this one, so please feel free to chime in! **tl;dr - gave my (now former) ta my number at the end of the semester, how long should i wait for him to reach out?**",advice,0,2692.0,520.0,3.0,0.0057692307692307696,0.007692307692307693,0.06153846153846154,5.0,0.0

"my (22m) gf (21f) with a past eating disorder has recently gained a lot of weight and i don't know how to talk about it. (tw: ed) before i start, i want to strongly stress that i love her very much and care a lot more about her as a person than her fysical looks. she has struggled from an eating disorder throughout most of her teenage years and still has a lot of mental scars from it. when i met her she didn't have an eating disorder anymore but that shit doesn't just go away. anyway, she was rather skinny when i first met her and gained some weight during our first year of dating, this was partially just some healthy relationship weight and partially due to some health issues that i won't go into. either way, that was not a problem at all, her body type is naturally a bit rounder and i think she looked great. (+i love a good butt). i made sure to tell her that often, as she's rather insecure and can use the reassurance. once she recovered from her health issues her weight kind of settled into what seemed like a comfortable and healthy weight.she has periods and moments when social media and stuff gets to her and makes her hate herself and her body saying that she has to lose weight, and i've always tried to reassure her and show her to love herself like i love her. she did pick up some regular excersising to try and lose some weight at one point and i always tried to support her while not pushing her and making sure she doesn't do too much. as i think it's healthy to excersise from time to time and didn't see the harm in it as long as she didn't exagerate.anyways, that's the background. that brings us to now, 2 years and a half into our relationship.recently, probably due to a number of stressfactors that are partially out of our control, she's stopped excersising and started comfort-eating more and started gaining some more weight; not massive amounts, i can barely tell( if at all) when i see her clothed. but i can when she sends me explicit pictures, and sometimes when we're intimate. at first i didn't consiously register it but i notice and feel less sexually attracted to her body (she has always had the prettiest face and nothing's gonna change that). and it's not all the time or every picture, certain poses or positions are just not as appealing anymore. this is not a massive isue for me but i fear it will put a strain on our relationship;because she expects me to react excited to those pictures and while i can try to fake some excitement, i think she'll notice it's not as excited. and it also just doesn't feel right to lie to her like that. on the other hand, i also don't want to tell her the truth (that sometimes, i'm less interested in her body because of her increase in weight, and that i would probably find her more sexually appealing if she lost some) because i know that that would destroy her. i realy don't know what to do about it and just kind of hoping that she either ends up losing some of the weight or that my brain learns to find her attractive like this too. ps: i want to stress that i do not blame her for gaining weight, as we're both going through a tough period in life and i've not maintained the best habits for myself either.ps2: she's not obese or anything like that, i think that even now she's probably still healthy if maybe a little bit overweight. but im not a doctor and i don't know her exact weight so don't take my word for it.ps3: she is already very self-consious about the weight she has recently gained, making it feel all the more important that i make her feel loved.",advice,0,3565.0,676.0,0.0,0.0,0.011834319526627219,0.060650887573964495,0.0,0.0

"how to break up with my partner (m 22) who's done nothing wrong? (f 22) before i start, some backstory about my partner and i. we've been talking since june but only became an official couple in october. he is the sweetest guy in the world and he takes care of me and listens and is basically everything anyone would ever want in a partner. however, i feel like ever since we became official, i began to have doubts about my actual feelings for him. i know what i'm like when i have feelings for someone and they're probably the same as most people (i.e missing them 24/7, wanting to see them everyday, always texting, etc) but with him, i just don't feel that. the beginning when we first started talking was very fun and flirty and i definitely think that there's still stuff like that now; but now i just don't believe that i liked him as much as i thought i did. what also could've played a part is our mutual friends: they were all rooting for us from the beginning, i think part of me also felt pressured to keep things going w/him because everyone kept saying what a great guy he was. but now that i'm actually in a committed relationship with him, i realized that i truly don't see a future with him or feel that ""spark"" of a connection. i feel like i've been faking my happiness of being in a relationship with him and i feel like shit. after doing a lot of thinking and self-reflection, i've decided to break-up with him. a small obstacle though is he is on vacation with his family right now for the holidays so i want to wait until he gets back to break the news so he doesn't associate the holidays w/sadness and pain. i feel like an asshole because i don't like him or want to be with him as much as he does with me, but at the same time i know you can't control your feelings and force something to happen that isn't there. i definitely want him to find someone who's more compatible with him and who can reciprocate the same feelings back, i am just not that person for him. at the end of the day, all i want is for him to be happy. he is an amazing guy and i don't want to leave any stones unturned. any advice for how to break the news?",advice,0,2154.0,418.0,5.0,0.011961722488038277,0.0023923444976076554,0.08851674641148326,2.0,0.0

"problems that can be solved with communication hello all, i'm seeking advice on my relationship between myself (26m) and my recent ex (25f). we started dating in early february of 2022 and the first few months were amazing. we met on bumble and she comes off as rather flat and uninterested through text, her profile had literally no information and all her pictures looked like they were really glammed up which made me think i might be getting catfished. nonetheless, i was absolutley blown away by her beauty and really wanted to speak with her so after 2 days of a steady texting conversation i wanted to set up a date with her since i figured she didn't seem super interested in the conversation (which i found out was not true at all, she just doesn't communicate well over text). i was still worried about being catfished so the day before the date i asked her to video call. we talked for four hours and she seemed very upbeat and was amazing to talk to and share stories of both of our different cultures. we met for our date the next day and had an amazing time and ended up talking for another four hours untill she had to go and pick up her dog from the daycare. we ended up talking on average 2 to 6 hours per day over video call for the next week and really felt like we knew almost everything there is to know about eachother just through speaking. obviously there is a lot to learn about a person as you are with them, but the things that could be expressed verbally were amazing. she really inspired me as a person who was able to overcome any challenge that life threw at her, raising a dog all on her own, moving to her dream city to pursue her dreams. she is truly an inspirational person in my life. she lives in another city about an hour and a half to two hour drive away, so one of the exciting things was exploring eachothers cities. we end up going on two dates before i look her in the eyes and ask her to be my girlfriend she said yes and we had an amazing relationship. we both really enjoyed talking to eachother and expressing ourselves. she grew up in a home where her father was rather abusive and had all three of her exes be somewhat abusive as well. she described what we had as a breath of fresh air and was really happy that she felt like she could he herself around me. we genuinely talked about a future and i felt so warm and welcomed by her family and friends and we were so excited to build a future together. over the next few months we spend a lot of time together, mostly me staying at her house for a few days to a week at a time (she rented her own apartment alone) and i work online so i was able to get any work i needed to done during the day when she was gone at work. i would help to clean the house as well in my spare time there. i was genuinely happy at this time, however when wanting her to watch one of my favorite movies, she just didn't seem like she respected this thing that i enjoyed and always sort of acted like it would be a chore. we watched the movie but she sat on her phone the whole time and in the middle of it got up to do her dishes and vacuum the apartment. i felt terrible like i was being really disrespected, but didn't really say anything and it didn't seem like she was listening. her and i both have the tendency to not open up about things unless they grow and become much bigger problems than they are and that was one of them and it always sort of bothered me after that. she would often make jokes about her ""other boyfriend"" to tease me. these jokes really bothered me because i didn't feel like we were secure enough at that point in our relationship to joke about those things. there was one point where she said ""you're just the intermediate. i'm with you to pass the time till the next one comes along"" and i was so angry. i didn't yell at her but i straight up told her once i cooled down that it really hurt me. she still would make the jokes but never that harsh and as we grew in our relationship i felt secure enough at times to joke along too. fast forward to june, she ends up getting a promotion at her job that ends up putting a lot of stress on her. meanwhile i start grad school and focusing on my language studies (was wanting to go for a certificate in a foreign language with the idea of maybe moving to another country someday). this took a lot of energy that i had to devote to our relationship and as time went on we talked over the phone less and less, almost never video calling and resorted to texting all the time (where we don't really communicate well). she complained angrily once that she felt like i was taking over her space, so we end up talking it out and i decide to keep my stuff neatly stored away and respect her home and her space more and to not spend so much time just hanging out at her house so she felt like she could have a balanced amount of alone time. i'm still heavy into my studies. this is a habit that i only recently broke where i hyperfixate on things and only with our breakup did it make me realize that i need to be more mindful of that and make those changes because it affects all of my relationships and my ability to enjoy life. fast forward to august she talks to me and tells me shes been really stressed latley over a lot of things but also that before she saw our future clearly but the last few weeks it was really blurry. i told her that i love her with all my heart and if she wants me to let her go i will let her go. she said no because there was still something there. we went on a vacation the next day to go and see some of her college friends and visit her college town and had an amazing time. we sat down and talked briefly and she said she felt like herself again and that things were okay. i was preparing for a trip to another country that i was studying the language for and completley devoted myself to it and even worse when i came back, barely talking to her outside of basic texts for the next few months and the occasional phone call. i would still go visit her every few weeks, but was never able to be decisive when making decisions about things to do and whenever she suggested maybe going downtown i would just say ""well theres probably traffic"". when i was overseas for those two weeks i would get a lot of messages saying she missed me and wished i lived closer to her (the only time distance ever seemed like an issue, otherwise she always made it clear that it wasn't). i was also sick with covid while abroad and sick a lot over the course of the last 2 months (october and november). these months i really felt like her behavior toward me became more neglectful. i have had issues before with mild panic attacks going to clubs and convert halls due to some past issues and one of her favorite things to do is to go out clubbing and dancing for fun. her cousins invited us and in the few hours before i sort of got really quiet and she really impressed me by sitting me down and looking me in the eyes and talking me through it. i felt like we had communicated better than we ever had before. we went and had an insane time and i found out that i really love clubbing and dancing and letting loose. the next day is thanksgiving. i'm a little tired from the night before because we woke up early the next day to get ready. we drive to her aunts house with me in the passenger seat. i have a tendency to get vertigo when in the car and i had it bad and it wouldn't go away the whole evening. we were there maybe 3 hours before she asked if i wanted to go home and we did. she didn't speak a single word to me and was clearly angry with me. she didn't ask how i was feeling or if i was okay and the next morning when i tried to hug her before she left for work she pushed me away. i had a feeling in my stomach that we might be breaking up soon because i didn't feel like i was being treated right. so rather than try to talk, my mind went straight to just breaking up. a few days later i'm back at home and i'm still angry over how she treated me. i pick up the phone to call her and she tells me she wants a kid before 30 and a house during our conversation. that she wishes i supported her dream of the house more and that i was more decicive and that what i viewed as healthy communication talking to me over the clubbing fears was her practically begging me. we get into a mild argument and she says we can try to work things out and see where we are by january. the way she described herself feeling was exactly how i felt with my ex. i was emotional and immediately said no and we broke up. i called her later asking if she would change her mind and she said no. i immediately reacted and deleted all pictures we had together off social media and removed the ""in a relationship"" off my facebook. which i i hurt her a lot. i went to her house next day to exchange our belongings and trying to maintain composure but i started crying. i told her my goals had changed and that what i really want in life is that nice little house and to share my life with her. she has always had a problem feeling like a burden and that she hates to see me hurting this way. we said our goodbyes and i left her house for the last time and said goodbye to her dog. the next few days were hell. i generally left her alone and took the advice of my friends not to text her other than to organize another meeting. she said it would be our last one. we organized it for monday the 5th. i just wanted closure. after speaking with my therapist, i ended up canceling the meeting and telling her we should both just take some time apart and think about things before meeting again. i called her a few days later to talk to her and ask her to reconsider. she responded saying that she was thinking about moving back to her college town where her friends are because she realized it was okay to not always challenge herself and to be where she's comfortable. i was basically her only support system in the city she always dreamed to live in. so i tell her everything i talked about with my therapist, that i feel like our relationship went the way it did because we didn't communicate the way we should have, that i have changed by goals because running away to another country was definitley not healthy for me at the time, that i am putting the people that i love in my life in first place rather than materialism or goals that just help me avoid life's responsibilities, and that i will be more decicive and a better communicator. she almost said yes, but said that it was too soon and that maybe we just didn't meet eachother at the right time. so we decided that we will stay in eachothers lives and be friends and not talk for a while. i have worked hard over the last few weeks on my relationships with others, to overcome my fear of certain things and indecisiveness and to realize there really are plenty of other fish in the sea. i am ready to accept that i may never be with her again and am losing the fear of that every day, but i still realize that because she is such an amazing person that i really want to build something new with her and want to contact her again after the holidays are over and see if she wants to meet up. this whole fiasco is a result of a failure of both of us, but especially me to listen and be there when needed. i know i will never make that same mistake with her again. reddit, what can i do?",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.006314839873703203,0.0009021199819576004,0.09156517816869644,1.0,0.0

"me and my gf always fighting and i always get the blame. i don’t know if this is the right move but i just need some advice. so i got back together with my ex, we dated about 1 years and had to end it due to always arguing. about 1 year later we decided to give it another go, 2 month in and everything was fine and after that we started arguing every day. for example the other day she texted me saying that she is gonna go out drinking with her friends and then go to her male friends house 1 on 1 to smoke weed, i replied by saying i’m cool with her going out but don’t feel comfortable with her going to his place to smoke as i don’t know the guy and i don’t know his intentions (she also mentioned couple times that he makes inappropriate jokes which i wasn’t too happy about but didn’t say anything). now after i said that she started getting annoyed as to why i don’t want her to go to his house and stuff and ended up with her just going out for drinks. the next day when she came over i sat down with her to talk about it, i explained to her that i overthink a lot and that i been in situations where i been cheated on and stuff, and again she starts saying stuff like “so now your saying that i will go and f#%* him”, “is this gonna be a issue every time i go out with my friends” which made me feel somewhat guilty, anyway she just kept blaming it on me in a way, someone let me know if i did something wrong. we had another argument, so normally we see each other friday to sunday, she stays over as during the week we both got work. she went out with her friends on saturday evening and said she will be home about 10pm so i said i will wait for her, i won’t lie i was a bit upset as i didn’t get to spend time with her on friday and also saturday now as she went out, but i didn’t say nothing. around 9pm i get a call from her asking if am allright with her going to the club as all her friends are now going there, and because i was a bit upset and because of the previous argument i just said “i would like for you to come home but you do what you want as my answer won’t matter” she seemed kinda fine with it. now she got home, again i got the blame for it and she started saying that i’m being controlling and apparently i said “no”. now again today another argument over a petty thing, so apparently she put something on my brothers desk and he came to give it to her, she got annoyed as he wasn’t exactly nice about it but she know that’s basically his and he can use it when he want if that makes sense, she got annoyed about it and started kinda talking back which i didn’t like as he was right so i just told both of them to leave it, she said something along the lines “why you always on his side” in a way i did not like but i just said “you two need to stop arguing” and then she tells me off because i was talking to her as she would say “like shit”, now i know some times she doesn’t realise that she might be rude towards me but this day she been talking with a tone most of the times and i just ignored it. now after she said that i was talking to her like shit, i just said “you been talking to me like that the hole time u been here” and i just left the room as i didn’t want an argument, but we haven’t spoken yet as she most likely is expecting me to come back and say sorry. can someone please give me some advice as i don’t want the relationship to end the same way it did the first time.",advice,0,3424.0,687.0,4.0,0.005547850208044383,-0.0027739251040221915,0.09153952843273232,0.0,0.0

"my ex came back into my life for 6 months and then just randomly blocked me with no explanation. this past june, my (26f) ex (25m) contacted me after almost two years of being apart. we dated on and off for about 5 years and have known each other since high school. he since started a relationship with someone else. he told me he missed me for a long time, and wanted to know if i’d be willing to talk to him. i was curious. i thought of him as the love of my life and i missed him too. he told me he wanted to break up with his girlfriend. (long story short, that didn’t end up happening.) he said he was unhappy with her, that he felt like he was losing himself and slowly being stripped away by being with her. his dilemma was that they live together and recently signed a new lease and didn’t want to lose a bunch of money by breaking it. he told me they were basically just roommates now and didn’t have much of a physical relationship. he told me all the things he missed about being with me, that i was the best thing in his life. we met a couple weeks after he initially contacted me and it was like no time had passed. our connection and the spark we had was still there. we ended up having sex. i know it was wrong, but at the time i honestly felt like he would leave his girlfriend and we would end up together. over the next several months, we kept in contact. we stayed up late talking, flirting, etc. right before my birthday, in august, we talked about our feelings for each other. he told me that the way i made him feel was special and how grateful he was to have experienced it at all. that i was important to him. i told him i felt the same way, and that our connection was something i’d never experienced with anyone else and how much i missed it when we were apart. he wished me a happy birthday and then after that, communication instantly fell short. we didn’t talk for all of september. i figured maybe he needed space and wanted to give that to him. he called me late one night in october and we had phone sex. we met up for drinks a few days later. he told me that things with his girlfriend had gotten a little better, but he yet he still contacted me. i wasn’t sure what to say. at this point, it seemed clear to me that he was just using me to fill a hole in his relationship, which i wanted no part of. i knew i wanted all or nothing with him and didn’t want to be a part of an ongoing affair. thanksgiving weekend, he reached out again and we chatted for a bit, and then he tried to turn to the conversation over to sexting. i called him out on it, and told him i didn’t appreciate him using me like that and that i wanted to feel respected. he apologized right away, but that was the last time we spoke. yesterday i noticed that he deleted me on snapchat. i texted him today and asked him why and he read my message, didn’t respond and then just blocked my number. i’m honestly so confused and hurt. i hate to think that he just used me and is now discarding me. especially after all we’ve been through and the amount of times he’s told me how much he cares for me. i just feel stupid. i also still feel horrible about his girlfriend, to my knowledge she has no idea about what happened between us. i think she has the right to know but i don’t think it would be good coming from me. please keep the mean comments to a minimum. i know my part in this was wrong, but i honestly cared and loved him so much that i think i didn’t see the situation clearly. i guess… what do i do now?",advice,0,3513.0,687.0,7.5,0.012711864406779662,0.005649717514124294,0.12146892655367232,1.0,0.0

help! need relationship advice please take time to read first off i’m new to this reddit thing but i’m looking for non bias advice. i(27f) have been in a relationship with my bf(27m) for around 6 years. we had a really rough start but i can honestly say i have never loved another significant other the way i love him. but i also have never been hurt by anyone the way he has hurt me. imma start off with the past. because all though he’s changed a lot it’s something that has really affected me. and maybe i shouldn’t mention it since it’s not relevant to our recent fight but it’s something that i have to deal with because he has changed he’s no longer that person or so i hope but i can’t help but wonder how i could forgive all this and he can’t take the fact that i’m messy. 1. he choose his ex over me and spent the night at her house while still texting me. it killed me. on time i remember i was on my way over he called me as i was on my way to cancel our plans which i was very excited for said he had to do something with his parents turns out he was talking with his ex. he even had me pick him up one at night when his car broke down at her house and my dumbass still drove for a long way to get him. 2. i caught him multiple times texting some girl. i told him to stop but he said they were just friends but she kept asking him to see her at work then i saw her send some inappropriate pictures. 3 same thing happens caught him texting another girl he said it was his cousin turns out she wasn’t. turns out they had made out and stuff again heart broken we broke up and … 4. he had a whole other relationship with another girl he tried to make it work with her but still kept leading me on and it finally took us the other girl and me to talk and figure out he was playing us both. he told me he wanted me and he wasn’t going to talk to her anymore. but he still did until eventually his birthday where i went to drop off a card and balloons at his house but he wasn’t responding at this point i knew where she lived and i saw them in his car broke my heart again but i still forgave him there were other but these were the ones that really got to me and now writing them down really goes to show how much hurt and pain but i learned to forgive it took me a lot and i got over it so i thought. i also wanted to point out that i have never cheated on him. we eventually needed up moving in together. things were great for a while he put in the effort and showing me more affection which is something that we had issues with before and the cheating stopped. things were great. but he didn’t have the greatest childhood he suffered and because of that he has some issues. he’s very easy to change up he gets fits of rage and he just changes. his anger issues where really starting to affect me. i always feel like i’m just not good enough. he will throw things slam doors even though a cup of water at my face he says he wasn’t aiming at me but i still was splashed with water. his anger has lead to physical things before in the past something i’ve never told anyone. and there’s a lot that i’m just not willing to share but yeah it’s been rough. but i know he knows if he were to ever lay hands on me again i would walk out for good no questions asked. i recently left the house to go back to my parents because we had one argument too many and i just couldn’t take it anymore. things are tight my parents house is small and i also took out dog i sleep on the couch but my parents always make me feel welcomed. i’ll admit i’m not the best gf ever. i don’t know how to cook and in fact it gives me mad anxiety. i’m very emotional. i’m also very forgetful and messy. i also smoke pot and i’m currently at my lowest. i lost my hr job i have a college degree but i’m working at wear house. i’ve been dealing with some health issues as well. i don’t ask for much we have always split financial stuff 50/50 including groceries rent house hold items and things for our dog. and i feel bad leaving him to pay the full rent. the last couple times we fought has been due to my messiness. he gets mad cause i forget to pick up my clothes from the restroom or i don’t close a cabinet door. or i left weed outside on top the washer machine. he also got mad that i chose to get ready before that house is clean even though he was sleeping while i was getting ready. he has told me before that it bugs him because he grew up with his mom always giving crap for doing stuff like that. and i tried to be more organized but i guess it’s not something that comes natural to me and sometimes i do forget and i’m willing to admit it’s true i am messy and i have been trying to change it’s just hard for me. so i feel hypocritical because i’m also asking him to change the way he reacts and talks to me which i know is also hard now i have been gone for a couple weeks and we have been trying to work on things cause i still do love him so much but his depression and anger issues have really taken a toll on me. and i saw he had added a girl on facebook who he had a relationship with before. i had previously told him to block her but he said he added her when we were still together not when i left. which i still find really disrespectful i told him i was hurt and he blocked her. i know he hasn’t cheated and he’s not trying to talk to anyone else he says he wants me but even though we had rebuilt trust it’s started to feel hard to trust again especially cause i’m not living with him. we have been trying to make it work but i still feel this tension and anxiety around him. i love him and i don’t want to let him go especially because i know he’s been through alot and i feel for him i grew up in a very loving family and he didn’t i wanted to show him that love and even though my parents have seen me suffer through this relationship they have constantly welcomed him with open arms because they wan me to be happy. i just don’t know if we’re just too different but i found me asking myself if i really wanted to be in the relationship multiple times . i know i love him i have no doubt i wouldn’t have forgave him for everything in the past if i didn’t and when we hang out i do love spending time with him he makes me laugh and i can be myself around him he says he will change and i want things to work but idk what to do anymore. do you think he will change his attitude. i want to be there for him because i know he’s depressed. i’ve asked him to get help but i know he has no health insurance. i just don’t know what to do go back home try to make it work give it one last chance or walk away but i know that it will hurt both of us.,advice,0,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.010699001426533523,0.003566333808844508,0.11626248216833096,0.0,0.0

"i (20 f) feel very much stuck in kinda toxic relationship with my girlfriend (20f) i hate that im doing this but i feel the need to word my emotions somewhere and i can't quite do it with my irl friends cause they all know the person this is about. tldr: we have been together for about a month and a half and now i am realising that she has a lot of red flags i cannot ignore but i don't know how to bring it up to her or if i should break up. anyways backstory time: my current girlfriend broke up with her girlfriend of almost 5 months on halloween so she could try and get together with me. when i asked her why she said she felt no emotion got together with a poor girl just cause she was bored and liked the fact that girl was very very in love with her. not exactly in those words but looking back that's the gist of it. about 2 months before that i got left by a guy i got really connected to and was very very hurt by it since it was my first relationship i thought of as serious. so anyways i am still grieving, and even tho i liked ivy ( fake current gf name) i personally wasn't ready for the relationship. i liked the close flirty friendship we had but i didn't want to commit to anything since i really wasn't ready. of course i told her that. she however continued to tell me how much she liked me and how she is persistent and how she will not stop until she gets what she wants. our friends kept telling us how we should get together cause we are "" so good for eachother"" and i gave in, well at first i jokingly called her my gf around her ex who is at our uni cause he keeps flirting with her. she kept making me tell her how i feel about her expecting me to say that i feel the same way she does ( she said multiple times how she is so in love with me) and even though so much time passed i don't think i can feel like that or at least not towards her. so now that we have been officially together for about a month i am realising that its becoming really really hard to ignore all the red flags about her and how she still acts so childishly getting mad when i don't answer her message or when im too busy to hang out with her or when i simply do not want to share my problems with her cause i know she isn't gonna be very helpful. i realise i had gotten myself stuck since im dating a person within a friend group who is more influential on the judgment of the whole group as an older member i do not have any support and will probably lose most of my friends if we break up. i do realise that if friends leave me over something pitiful as a breakup they are not much of a friend group at all but im really comfortable with them and i really like them, they are basically my entire support system in uni and i don't want to lose that too. so i honestly need some advice, should i try to bring it up and salvage this relationship or should i break up. i know that breakup will really really hurt her and i'm trying not to postpone it too much because it will only make things worse, but i really don't know what to do to make this as painless as possible, usually im the one who gets really attached and people leave me so i really don't want her to see me the way i see my exes since i do care about her a lot there are just a lot of things that are crossing my line about her and i feel like being alone would be better for me.",advice,0,3349.0,677.0,7.5,0.01772525849335303,0.005908419497784343,0.10930576070901034,0.0,0.0
"should i go on this date? help so i (23f) have been talking to this guy (26m) for a short while. since dec 9th to be exact. we have learned a lot about each other in this short time but i always find that the conversation is always surrounding my weight/body type and my sex life. the first thing he texted me after we greeted each other for the first time was “i don’t have a lot of luck on this app. i don’t know why. i respect women 100% and i’m not a creep or anything.” as a woman i know for a fact that if we was a genuine guy he would be in a relationship by now. that also goes both ways and i understand i’m not perfect and can be toxic at times which is why i’m still single. so i overlooked that statement and decided to continue having conversations with him. after all, i’ve never been in a real relationship so i don’t know how this should work. what started as simple questions like “so are you skinny, thick, or athletic?” became “do you have small boobs or big boobs?” or “is your butt big?” and then eventually “how much do you weigh.” these questions wouldn’t annoy me so much if i didn’t have full body profile pictures. he can clearly see that i’m of small stature and size and he asks this anyway. it’s important for me to point out that i am a bisexual woman and i’m more interested in women. i told him this and he responded “i’d love to watch you go at it with girls.” as if my attraction to women is just a tool for him to get turned on. he is always talking about sex and it makes me feel like an object. like that’s the only way he can connect with a woman. it sucks to admit but if the girls i swiped right on matched with me i wouldn’t be talking to men at all. i don’t know if every guy behaves this way and this is how men normally express interest in women or if i’m dealing with an actual creep. we’re supposed to go on a date tomorrow but i’m not really up for it. then again, i’m never excited about going on dates with men. any advice would help and be appreciated! 🤗",advice,0,2004.0,419.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09069212410501193,4.0,0.0

"unhappily married girl wants me hi everyone! i need an advice on the following situation; im 39 (m), separated and a father to a 5 year old. been single for the last 5 years with numerous women passing by but with no real spark to have a serious relationship which i truly wish for. last month on a business meeting i met a girl (33) and we really hit it of on a friendly basis which quickly set off a really nice chemistry in the best way possible. we agreed to stay in touch and she contacted me a week ago to meet for lunch. we had a really great time and opened up to each other completely. and here comes the problem; she is married 8 years with a guy that is almost 60 and has a daughter with him (7). she married him after a week of knowing him based on the fact that she has done everything what her surrounding expected from her during her life and she decided to do something completely unheard for. now she realizes the burden of her choice and has been talking to her husband how to get out of their marriage. the problem is that they have accumulated a lot of wealth in between the time, especially him having the most of the wealth. my friendly advice to her was to try to solve the situation in the best interest of the kid and then her, cause it is evident she cant spend her life with him. i told her not to entangle with anyone untill she is ""free"", cause if it goes sideways, the biggest collateral would be her child. the problem i have is that i believe in the sincerety of her words and the fact that the way she looks at me is the way a man wants a woman to look at him. i felt that once in my life and i know how it feels and looks. i was completely shocked that day because i was almost sure i am never gonna experience that in my life again. i am not in love with her by any means, but i feel the potential it has, because i felt the connection from the moment we looked at each other the first time. now we chat (initiated from her side) on a weekly basis and she is always complimenting me. i do not know how to respond to this. my gut tells me i should let her know how i feel but untill she is not divorced i cannot get into a situation like this. advice? thank you!",advice,0,2196.0,433.0,2.0,0.004618937644341801,0.0023094688221709007,0.07390300230946882,1.0,0.0
"my (30f) gf (29f) has a promise w one of her best straight guy friends that they’ll have a kid together if they’re both single by a certain age me and my gf have been together for a little over 2 years, and ngl everything is pretty good - there’s really no major problems in our relationship and lately we’ve been talking about our long term lives together. the thing is, my gf told me a couple months ago that her and her best straight guy friend (let’s call him tony) both agreed years ago that if they were still single by a certain time that they would have kid(s) together. i know and understand that my gf told me this in a lighthearted and joking way; it felt kind of like, “isn’t this such a funny story?” however in the moment it really caught me off guard and i feel like i’m still processing that statement, and trying not to get lost in a jealously spiral. i know tony well-enough and nothing about their friendship has ever concerned me, but now i’m feeling 2nd fiddle to the “longterm” planning that they’ve put together and now i feel like i’m her back-up plan, while her “official” plan is to have a family with tony. additional context: tony has helped her financially before, during our relationship, without her asking to, which she happily accepted, but she will get anxious/upset at me when i try to do the same. which has created a weird unbalanced dynamic in my mind. i would ask my friends for advice but i know they will take my side and validate my feelings, which is the opposite of what i want rn. i’m hoping for some unbiased honesty instead - am i being unfair to my gf for not trusting her or are these actual concerns that i should bring up to her? any advice is appreciated. :-)",advice,0,1711.0,332.0,1.0,0.0030120481927710845,0.0,0.09939759036144578,2.0,0.0

"my (23f) boyfriend (24m) and i had a fight and i don’t know if we should break up my boyfriend and i have been together for the last 2 years and a half, and everything has been great the first year, but lately l've been thinking about our relationship. this past year a few things happened that made me think that he doesn't care about me as much as i thought he did. but i don't know if l'm being selfish and i expect too much or he's the one who's wrong. let's start with the fight that happened 3 days ago. we both work and he's currently in a town 3 hours away from me for work, and he'll be there until the end of the christmas holidays, which is around the 6th or 7th of january. usually we're an hour away from each other. he's been there since the beginning of december, and he came to visit me the first weekend, almost two weeks ago. then we planned that this week i was going to visit him, we both would decide a day so it worked for both of us. i have other friends in that town so i planned to spend the afternoon with them and the evening (towards 6 or 7pm) with him, i would spend there the night and we could spend the morning together before i would go home. so on tuesday, two days before, he asks me when l'm going to visit him, and i tell him thursday if it's okay with him and he says yes. the next morning we were on the phone and he asks me again when l'm going there, i say tomorrow, like we agreed, and he says okay that's perfect. he calls me again that afternoon and after a while talking he asks me if l'm for sure coming tomorrow. i'm a little confused at this point but i say yes, and he says that he agreed last night to have dinner out with his cousin tomorrow, but that i could go with them. at this point l'm a little pissed, but i just ask why didn't you tell me sooner? and he said he forgot. so i ask him to cancel with his cousin, that i don't particularly like, also because of our jobs we wouldn't be able to see each other again before the end of the holidays, christmas makes our jobs much more busy. also his cousin lives close to that town, and he sees him often. so i told him no, that i wouldn't go with them, i just wanted to spend time with him, i didn't want to spend the whole evening listening his cousin talk. i also forgot to mention that he told me that he had to work in the afternoon, and could only see me in the evening, that's why i planned to see my friends in the afternoon. but he got pissed and said that it wasn't fair that i got to spend time with my friends and he couldn't see his cousin (he see that guy almost every day now). but after a while he agreed that it would only be the two of us but i had to find a restaurant because he doesn't know any places around there and i had to call and make reservations right now because he didn't want to cancel with his cousin for nothing. and i was like if you think seeing me it's nothing l'm not coming don't worry, enjoy dinner with your cousin. and we didn't talk the rest of the day. the next day, i was supposed to go there but i didn't, and he texted me around noon asking me what i was going to do. i told him ""i'm not coming"" and he had the audacity to ask why. so i told him that i iust didn't feel like it and he told me that i was acting like going to see him was a chore and then he was like ""okay we'll see next time if i feel like visiting you"" so i told him not to bother and we didn't speak again. it's been three days and i don't know what to do. i really felt like while i was organizing and planning he really didn't want me there. and other things that bothered me this year he didn't get me a present for my birthday, our anniversary and last christmas. i always get him presents in those occasions because i care and i like to see his face when he opens them and i think that that's a normal thing to do. but when l asked him why he just says that he never knows what to get me. even when i told him last christmas that it doesn't have to be nothing big, just anything that shows that he cares. but he just doesn't.. bother. and was just accepting it because he really didn't seem to have a clue but now i feel kinda dumb. and it's not even a money problem because he always offers to pay when we're out together, even if we take turns to pay every time. and the first year we were together he got me a gift for my birthday, one for christmas and one for our anniversary, and they were beautiful. he also slapped me once but he was drunk and i forgave him, i feel pathetic now. of course there's also a lot of positive things, i feel great when i'm with him and we laugh a lot and we talk about everything, i feel like he's my best friend. just thinking about breaking up with him makes me want to cry and i miss him after these three days of not talking. but i hate to feel like he doesn't care. maybe i should say that he's my first boyfriend, and that i don't have any other experience. i really don't know what to do because i feel pissed but maybe l'm just exaggerating and we were even talking about getting married in three or four years, but now thinking about it just gives me anxiety. tldr: i feel like my boyfriend doesn't care about me and i don't know if i should stay with him. i know it's very long and i'm sorry also forgive me if i made any mistakes, english is my second language. thank you to anyone who'll take the time to read and to anyone who'll answer!!",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,2.0,0.0018399264029438822,0.0027598896044158236,0.10855565777368906,1.0,0.0
"is he losing interest throw away cause im deleting after. i have been dating my boyfriend for three years [both 25] and i feel like recently that he's losing interest. i am an overthinker and worrier, and would like some outside perspective that isn't anyone from work or my friends. i would like to say he is an amazing guy. we have similar interests, he is funny and kind. the best and only boyfriend i have ever had. however i feel like i am getting mixed signals to whether he is still interested in me. our relationship isn't as progressed as other 3 year long relationships go. it's embarrassing saying that we haven't held hands, cuddled (unless i'm alseep-- i'm a light sleeper), or even had sex. the furthest we have done is a quick peck on the lips at the end of our dates. that kiss is 9/10 initiated by me. we haven't dropped the l-bomb either. we started our relationship just before the pandemic hit, but surely we would have done more than kiss by now? i have tried sparking it. on our holiday together alone, walk in the bedroom with a towel on. no glance. nose in his phone. he went straight for the bathroom after me. he's taking longer and longer to reply to my messages, claiming that messenger hadn't alerted him of my messages, but he's been chatting to other people fine (i can see when he was last active... and no one else is having issues getting notifications). he used to reply almost instantly when i messaged towards the start of our relationship. i still message back instantly, now i feel like i am coming off as desperate? and when i do get a response, it's short/hard to keep the convo going messages. both last year and this year he had been invited as my plus one for my work's christmas party. everyone has been wanting to meet him. i want my work friends to meet him. both times he has declined, excusing that he has to be at work early the following day (i don't want to disclose what he does for a living) or babysitting.. i have been questioned by my work both years why i haven't brought my date... and it is getting to the point where majority believe that i am lying and he's not real. i understand that he has work, but myself and colleagues said that he could come and meet people, show his face for an hour or so and go home (that party started at 7- and work paid for everything so money wouldn't have been an issue, and the party is local so not far at all). i want him to meet them and show off my boyfriend. can't do that if he's not there! my friends at work have been saying to each other (behind my back) that i need to get laid, and i'm started to question if he is still interested in me? i like to think of myself as a beautiful woman. i am a pretty woman. but when your relationship is lacking physical intimacy or not spending as much time together or talking as you used to, it knocks you down a bit. i mean, last year, i had danced with a friend from work (at the first party he declined to) and felt i had more attention from him in one dance (nothing happened besides dancing) than my boyfriend of three years. and all i could think whilst dancing with my friend that it should have been my boyfriend there. my colleagues thought i should have dated that colleague instead. tried convincing me to set up a date (whilst with boyfriend still) to see if that went anywhere (i declined, obviously). i nearly ended it last year. because it felt like he wasn't interested (i wrote a long paragraph) and lack of phycially intimacy (basically same reasons as today) and he came back with he would be better etc. it was everything i wanted to hear. now that it's the end of the year, i feel like we are in the same boat as last year. we don't talk about the future, and i am starting to get ready to move out year after next. he's said that he would prefer to live alone, at first. hes not got a date of when he wants to move out by. despite all that, i met both sides of his family and he's met mine (after months of asking to meet mine)... this year and there's talks of doing me going on a holiday with his family plus family events. so surely there must still be some interest there? i'm at a loss. speaking to him about the issues last year hasn't changed anything. i'm struggling. and i have been so patient that i deserve an award. but i am not sure how much longer i can go for? is he losing interest? cause i feel like my nightmares are coming true. tldr. i think my bf is losing interest after no talks of the future and lack of physical intimacy after three years together.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,3.0,0.0034802784222737818,0.001160092807424594,0.09396751740139211,5.0,0.0

"dating someone with ocd. i’m looking for some advice about what to do in this situation. my partner (m 35) and i (f 28) have been dating for 2 1/2 years. he has severe ocd to the point where he doesn’t have a job. let me start off by being clear that unfortunately his ocd has put a severe strain on our relationship. here are the things that bother me the most: 1. he has to speak his mind, no matter how rude/ mean it is. he will almost constantly comment about my weight, make fun of my thighs being larger/ the shape of them, wishes he was dating a skinny girl, jokes around about leaving me for a skinny girl. he will call me really mean and nasty names when he is angry. i have expressed so many times how much this stuff upsets me… he blames his ocd and tells me they’re just words. when it does get to me i’ll cry… which only makes the situation much much worse. he will just get very angry and won’t console me. 2. he needs constant reassurance, while i am never reassured about anything. when he says the words above ^ i feel insecure and bad about myself. when i seek reassurance he gets angry with me and if we are talking on the phone will often hangup on me. 3. he has to have pretty much complete control of everything at all times. if we have plans to go do something and something happens where we can’t fulfill those plans… well let’s just say i get verbally assaulted/blamed for the situation every single time and a huge argument erupts. he will rearrange my home (he doesn’t live here) when i specifically will ask him please not to. 4. i often do not get a say in anything we do. he will come over with plans already set about what we’re going to do and never bothers to ask me what i would like to do. 5. when one of his routines are interrupted, whether it be my fault or not, i get screamed at and snapped on. this happens almost every time we see each other. i am trying to be so patient with this man…. but it’s really wearing thin. i don’t even feel like i’m in a relationship at this point, but rather just a care taker. at this point i’ve been come this insecure person and cant even begin to work on it when i have someone in my ear constantly telling me all these horrible things about myself. ps he sometimes takes medication (which you need to be consistently taking for months for it to help). refuses to get therapy or help himself. i’ve literally begged him in tears to get therapy and help but he just won’t.",advice,0,2446.0,479.0,2.0,0.0041753653444676405,-0.006263048016701462,0.08977035490605428,0.0,0.0

he said he didn’t drink but just passed out fast asleep. i was left to host his large family alone. few hours later on the same day we all heard some thud sound. i went and noticed my husband was in the bathroom. he had fallen and he was showering whilst drunk. i helped him and he went to bedroom and fell asleep. the following 3 days he was just sleeping and at midnight disappearing somewhere for 30 minutes or so. i would wake him up at dinner time to ensure he ate. he would smell of alcohol. then one day he is sober and says he has been self medicating and it isn’t helping his grief. i reassured him that i will help him and was glad he saw the light. however, the next day i suspected he began drinking again. as i could smell it and he was crashing out again. to the point he was missing out on his mother’s doctors appointments and the funeral arranging appointments. all of which i attended on his behalf. naturally, his mother was upset and she would share her concerns with me. i didn’t tell her about the drinking. i asked my husband “have you been drinking? if you have, i won’t judge you, but just so i can help you in the right way”. he told me he hadn’t been drinking. during this time my own mother had some problems of her own. so i was dealing with my husband being drunk, helping my mil and mother and also organising a catholic funeral. bare in mind i’m not catholic so all this is new to me. as well as going to work and doing the usual household chores. this carried on for few days. my husband being drunk (him denying drinking), passing out asleep, randomly leaving home at night and randomly tripping where i would have to lift him up. one day i notice my husband is sitting with coffee spilled all around his feet. it has been two weeks since his father had passed. i clean it up and i discover under the table there is an empty bottle of vodka. i got annoyed and told him this wasn’t the answer. i also was annoyed because he had been drinking in the same room as the quran. i said i needed the night to myself. i left that evening to stay the night at my mother’s. i got an angry text from him saying i deserted him when his father died. i went back. he is awake but drunk. i got him some food and tucked him in bed after. i also booked him an appointment with the doctor as my husband told me he was struggling. the next day he was sober and came to me and said he felt guilty. that he was running away from the funeral, his mother and put a lot on my plate. immediately i reassured him it was okay and i was here to support him to help him face the reality and help his mother. we agreed drinking wasn’t the answer. things were decent for few days. then one day i smelt alcohol from him again. i asked him. he denied it. in fact he got rude telling me it was in my head. i didn’t say anything back. i was civil to him afterwards and didn’t mention this topic. the next day (3.5week since passing) i discovered a beer bottle cap. i confronted my husband. i told him he had lied to me and gaslit me into thinking it was in my head. he once again disrespected our faith by drinking in the house right in front of the quran. he began to get rude. i told him i had enough and i couldn’t keep compromising on my faith beliefs for him any more. and that he has become a liar. he got rude to me and he hit my wrist and dragged me. i fell and hit my head and his response was “good you deserve it”. then he calmed down and we spoke. i told him i think he is beginning to develop an addiction and he is burying his head and needs to face the death of his dad as the funeral is only some days away. and that he needs to support his mother as she is grieving too. i also told him if drinking is his coping mechanism and he will continue doing it then our marriage won’t work in the long run. he was willing to work on it. we agreed the next day we will pray together. the next day we prayed our 5 prayers. i went out for a bit. when i came back, my husband is talking to me and i notice his speech is slurry. i asked if he drank, he said no. i accepted his answer. we both went to sleep and at one point i get up thinking i can smell alcohol and it’s coming from my husbands mouth. i go to the living room and noticed there was an empty large bottle of wine. my husband came in and saw i discovered it. i didn’t say anything at all. he start yelling at me and put his coat on and left home. hours went by. i went out looking for him. he was in the parking lot in his car. he was passed out on the drivers seat with another large empty wine bottle. his key was on the seat and his door was half opened. he reeked of booze. i was really nice to him when trying to get him up and bringing him home. mentally i was struggling however, as i am not used to drunk people and have not been bought up in an environment where there is booze. i bring him home and he starts yelling at me that i was purposely trying to shame him. i reassured him wasn’t trying to. i did him that i believe he now has a drinking problem based on how much he is drinking daily. the funeral is also less than 40 hours away and he still has not sorted his speech and currently is passed out drunk. i’m at this point where i feel stuck. a part of me wants to walk away from this marriage because it conflicting with my faith and i made it clear before marriage that alcohol was a big no no. i feel overwhelmed dealing with his drunk behaviour and he has become rude and now has put his hands on me. didn’t even feel remorse. on the other hand, i do care for him and don’t want to see him go in a downward spiral. tl:dr. both muslims so alcohol is forbidden. agreed before marriage that we are both non drinkers. after marriage, husband father died and husband starts to drink excessively, begins to lie and puts his hands on me. downward spiral. don’t know what to do.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.006122448979591836,0.0013605442176870747,0.0945578231292517,2.0,0.0

"my girlfriend jump hugged a friend and it made me kinda uncomfortable my (m20) girlfriend (f18) of 2 weeks and i were at a party when a family friend she’s known for years came over. she was so excited she ran up to him and dropped everything we were talking about and jump hugged him wrapping her legs around him i completely understand how excited she was to see him and considering how long they’ve known each other it’s normal how close they are the thing is, i would feel uncomfortable personally if a female friend did that to me, but we may just have different boundaries on this. i’m thinking about bringing this up so we can talk about physical boundaries together, but i don’t know if i’m just overreacting or if this is a little bit weird. it really made me uncomfortable in the moment, i don’t want to seem insecure either. edit: it’s not that i don’t want her hugging people or being physically affectionate towards her friends. i just think this was a little overly affectionate, this kind of leg wrap hug isn’t something i’ve ever seen friends do before. i’ve always viewed this as a relationship hug thing, like you haven’t seen your girlfriend in awhile so she jumps into your arms. any advice is appreciated edit 2: so i talked to her about it and at first she denied it and made some excuses like she fell and he caught her and that she didn’t really jump on him, but i insisted she did and that i’m not upset i just want to talk to her about it. she apologized and understood where i’m coming from and told me she doesn’t think of him like that and said she thinks of him as a uncle and has to realize that she’s not young anymore and it’s not appropriate. i feel so much better now, still a little weirded how she denies it first but i’m glad we worked it out.",advice,0,1781.0,354.0,0.0,0.0,0.002824858757062147,0.07909604519774012,0.0,0.0

"confused romantic feelings about my (f18) long distance best friend (m18). about to visit for first time in 3 years and don't know if i should tell him that i have romantic feelings for him again i (18f) have known my best friend, michael (18m), for 5 years. we met at the start of high school in a large group of friends but started getting really close in our second year. i would spend almost every weekend at his house, go to his sport matches and we would hang out all the time during school. he is incredible. he had always seemed so shy and surly until i got to know him. in reality he's quirky and kind and compassionate. and he's got these super expressive eyebrows, i just love them so much. every little arch they do makes my insides melt. about 8-9 months into us getting really close, my family and i immigrated to a different country on the other side of the world. i was devastated to leave him. within a week of arriving in my new home i started to realise that my feelings for him weren't altogether platonic. we continued to text almost everyday and video called once a week. we exchanged birthday presents and flowers for valentines day, while slowly building up this very flirty little long distance relationship. about a year and a half after the move i confessed that i had feelings for him and to my absolute delight he felt the same way. despite this 'life-altering' revelation, nothing much changed; we continued on just as we always had, except that the flirty texts were no longer hidden under ten layers of sarcasm. we never officially called it dating, it seemed hard to at that distance; no way to go out or kiss or even hold hands. but we did have a non-verbal agreement that we were waiting around for each other. this went on for about a year. fast forward to a few months ago. at this point my family were planning on returning to visit for the first time since we'd left (3 years). we had been excitedly planning our reunion and all the things we wanted to do, like go on an actual date. i finished high school (he still had a few months left, i was put forward a little when we moved for ease of transition) and started university. all the while, i started to feel things shift. being in university and making new friends (moving to a foreign country right before a pandemic does not make life easy) gave me a newfound freedom and i was really happy and feeling like myself again. as i got busy starting uni, michael got busy with final exams and we had less and less time for messaging and weekly calls. at some point i realised i was no longer falling asleep dreaming about him, or fantasising about what life would be like if he were around. i made a decision; we sat down on a call and i told him i loved him (we had said that before this) but that i felt it was only as a friend and that i wasn't sure i had romantic feelings for him anymore. i explained that since i'd started working and studying i felt like i had grown a lot as a person. and realistically we wouldn't be able to have a real relationship. we would've spent a few weeks together before going back to our long distance lives. my hope that he had secretly felt this shift too was dashed. he was shocked and a little disappointed, but said that with time things would be easier. he still loved me too and valued me as a friend. he said he appreciated my honesty. it was important for me to tell him before i arrived back, because of all the plans we had discussed and expectations that had been set. and much like when i had told him i liked him, life continued on as normal. university assignments piled up, he went into a study induced hibernation period for finals, but all the while we kept talking. but then something strange happened. life got quiet again, the christmas break rolled around and suddenly i started thinking differently about him again. dreams returned and i had to restrain myself from throwing suggestive quips into our conversations. help me fellow redditers. i've got three weeks left before i arrive back for a four week holiday. do i tell him that my feelings have returned before i get there or do i wait and see what happens when we're around each other again? or do i perhaps say nothing at all? he's my best friend and the last thing i want to do is hurt him, but i'm also scared i'll throw away this small window we have to see if we work in person. tldr: had feelings for ld best friend, told him, feelings changed, told him, then feelings came back. should i tell him before i visit in three weeks?

"do i (38m) have a solid future with my fiance (28f) who has struggled with her sexuality? my fiance amy and i have been together for 10 years. when we first met she had a girlfriend and she was only with women before. it turns out we had a spark and i was able to talk her into ending it with her girlfriend and start seeing me. the first 5 years of our relationship was amazing. she still had an attraction to women so as long as i was involved we invited women into our bed and had our fun. there was one girl in particular christina (25f) that she particularly liked and she became our only 3rd partner for the next year. but i didn't think anything of it at the time, which looking back was foolish of me. amy sat me down 4 years ago and said though christina and her didn't go behind my back and cheat, amy had strong feelings for her and thought she might actually be a lesbian. i asked her if she was breaking up with me and she said she wasn't but she wanted to temporarily take time apart so she can explore her feelings with christina because she felt a strong connection. i was so in love with her and we'd been together for 6 years that i got her to agree to staying with me and not moving out. and that we could open up the relationship so she could explore these feelings with christina. told her this would be the best for her too since we live in nyc and rent is insanely expensive here and i was already covering all the bills. amy to her credit tried to keep our relationship exactly the same, we still lived together, were affectionate with each other the way a couple would be, she'd even invite christina a few times over so the three of us could play. but once or twice a week, she would leave for a date night or even spend the night with christina. the resentment built for a year and one morning when amy came back home after spending the night with christina i asked her if this goes both ways and i'm able to see other girls too. i don't even think i had the right to be angry because i'm the one that came up with this stupid idea. she was taken back by the question but said it was ok if i wanted to date too and we keep things between us the same. i tried tinder and bumble for a few months and did some casual dates but i didn't really like anyone too much. i wasn't even interested in anyone, honestly looking back i just wanted to hurt amy. so that's what i did, i did some research online and hired an escort over that was even younger and more beautiful than amy. i timed the appointment at a time so amy would come home from work around the time the escort and i were in our bedroom. by the time we were done and i was walking her out amy was in the living room drinking a glass of wine. she kissed me good night and to call her back and left. after she left amy asked me who she was and wtf i was doing i just lied and told her it was a girl i'm seeing for some fun just like her and christina. she said this was different and she at least tried to be respectful and not rub it in my face and kept it out of the house. we argued for a few hours, she cried, we screamed, and went to bed angry. the next morning she tearfully told me she just wanted to stop all of this. said she would end it with christina and we could just be a normal couple. said seeing me with another woman was incredibly painful for her and she didn't want to experience that again. i agreed that i wanted that too. she ended it with christina which ended up being a more difficult than we thought. christina blamed me and would not stop reaching out to amy to rethink things and even reached out to me a few times calling me a all kinds of names. after that we've slowly gotten to a good place again. a few months ago, we found out amy was pregnant and we should be welcoming our baby boy around late spring. don't plan on having a big ceremony but something small for the family and getting married around february. but i've had this nagging fear for the last few years that amy will still wake up one morning and decide she's a lesbian and leave me. ever since we found out we're expecting, this has become more than a nagging fear. it's been bothering me a lot actually. even with amy being great i start thinking, is she overcompensating because she has feelings for women and trying to be hetero? do you guys think i have reason to worry?",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,4.0,0.004689331770222743,-0.0023446658851113715,0.08206330597889801,3.0,0.0

"my housemates keep doing stuff that irritates me but i don't know how to say anything without sounding incredibly bitchy. hey all. so, i (20m) live with four people. they're all generally pretty good housemates, but two of them, let's call them b and d (both 19m) can sometimes be a little... inconsiderate. making tons of noise, 'arguing' in the common areas even after i asked them to tone it down a little (not completely, it's just that the way they tend to do it means i can't tell if it's real argument or playing around, which triggers me slightly due to past trauma), fucking loudly in b's room when they both know we can all hear them from that room but can't hear them from d's room. they also do things like leaving the upstairs bathroom an absolute mess (though one of my other housemates admittedly does the same thing with the downstairs bathroom). the current issue is the washer and dryer. being in a relationship, b and d do their laundry together. they're travelling down to b's home city tomorrow, and so want to get all their washing done before then. they've taken over the washer and dryer for the past few days. i need to do my own washing, but i have significantly less. i don't own many clothes, all my clothes add up to one load of washing, and my mum taught me to never put in washing unless it's a full load (trying to get out of that mindset because i recognize it doesn't work with my current situation). this means that by the time i have a full load of washing, i have basically no clothes left. which is the current situation. the housemates in question know this, as i had asked if there would be time i think yesterday for me to get my washing in between their loads of washing. at the time, when d said there wouldn't be, i said it'd be fine because i didn't have plans on going out so i can just chill in my room in an oversized hoodie. i had thought i'd be able to do my washing by now. but i have not. b and d keep just leaving their stuff sitting in the washer and dryer instead of sorting it out, taking ages to get to it. at this rate i'm going to have to either wait till tomorrow to do my washing or do it at some stupid hour early in the morning if i actually want to have clothes tomorrow.

"i don't know if i should stay with my bf or not please help! i 22f) have been been with my boyfriend (22m) for 3 1/2 years now. we got together unexpectedly the end of our senior year of high school after i got out of a verbally abusive relationship that was beginning to get physical. i was not looking for a relationship and when we met we instantly clicked. for 2 years we rarely fought but there were so many issues i was having throughout the relationship that i was afraid to speak to him about (because of my last relationship). he's always had a tough shell and never really let me in, he didn't know what he wanted to do with his life and never wanted to go out or do anything unless it was him with his friends. our first 2 years together we celebrated birthdays, holidays, extra. but, in the last 2 years he hasn't celebrated anything and told me every holiday was a waste of time and money even though i was getting him gifts. we worked through a lot of it but i always felt like i was 10steps behind him because he always told everyone around us what was going on in his life and usually they would accidentally tell me thinking i already knew. all of this we were able to mostly talk through but still bugs me frequently. i always got along super well with his family and he with mine and marriage was always a discussion on the table. however, when we both turned 21 he turned into a whole new person, always drinking heavy, ditching me to go party, canceling plans and would make comments to me about how ""i'm not worth marrying"" and that "" i'll never find someone else because nobody else would want to put up with me and my nagging"". when we would discuss it he'd brush it off that i was making a big deal out of nothing and it was just drunk words. i then noticed he was being weird about his phone (we never hid anything from each other so neither one of us ever had a reason to go through each other's stuff) so when this behavior was starting to get out of hand i regrettably looked through his messages. he was bashing me to his friends and was flirting with two women our age from his work and sending their pictures to his buddy's talking about how hot they are and making inappropriate comments. i brought it up and we talked about it, he cried and said it wasn't gonna happen again but i decided to break it off. we were split for around 2 weeks and i realized i wanted him back in my life and i wanted to fix it so we did and everything was getting better until october 2022 when i noticed he was messaging those girls again, but he kept telling me it was just work related (definitely wasn't). our hobbies include going to a line dancing bar near us where i go dance and he plays pool and at the halloween party a week later i met a really nice guy (21m) who has been nothing but kind to me these last 2 months of just friendship. im starting to develop feelings for him now but im afraid that by breaking up with my boyfriend and chasing after him i am making a huge mistake that i may regret later. this new guy also tends to get a lot of girls numbers while at the bar and while he only hangs out with and dances with me, he still makes rounds getting their numbers and texting them. he said it's because im already in a relationship but i feel it could have a possibility of still being a problem even if i did break up with my bf. i feel like im gonna end up with a double heart break. i'm also really struggling with all of this being during the holidays as i don't want to ruin it for either of us. tldr: my boyfriend (22m) and i (22f) of four years have had a lot of relationship turmoil on his half involving secrets and other women that we have decided to work through. however, i very recently met somebody else as friends but i'm starting to develop feelings and i'm not sure if it's worth risking my relationship or if i should break up with my boyfriend for a chance at a fresh start with this new guy.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,5.0,0.006613756613756613,0.0013227513227513227,0.10052910052910052,0.0,0.0

"should i stay or should i go? hello. i’m 25f currently in a ldr with 27m. we met about a year ago online and liked each other enough that we continued to talk to each other despite not living in the same country. honestly i was looking for something serious and made it very clear to him. he wasn’t necessarily on the same page as me at first but liked me enough that he decided to see where the talking took him. the relationship progressed and earlier this year i took a trip to meet him for the first time. why me and not him? i had vacation and he had just changed jobs and it was too soon to say that he was leaving on vacation. it went well and we made our relationship official afterwards. it’s been long distance ever since it begun. we’ve met up a couple more times. he visited me in my home country and we even had a trip together to las vegas. i’ve met his family and has met mine. whenever we have been in person, it’s been a very wonderful relationship. when we are apart, things get rocky at times. right now we are at an impasse and my heart feels heavy and i need some advice. last week in the middle of a fight he broke up with me. it was very surprising. ever since, he has apologized and explained that he didn’t mean to break up with me like that. that he didn’t mean the words that he said and regretted the outburst. what he meant was that the ldr was growing heavy on him and he was very conflicted about what it would mean to continue it. he says that the only way to end the ldr is to get married and buy a house together. a step that he is very scared to take because all of the relationships he has seen in his life have ended in divorce. that his parents’ divorce made him cry a lot as a child and he doesn’t want to go through something like that. about getting married or moving in together he says, “i don't necessarily know that i don't want to take [that risk], it's just a tough call given that i'm not sure if [our fights] will either get much better or if we're committing to living with fights lest we break up and have to saw the couch down the middle as we look for new apartments” he also says, “like you usually say those things can be worked on, i can work on managing my emotions when i am triggered and you can work on finding and avoiding my triggers. i just don't know if the cost benefit for putting the work in to solve those issues for both of us lines up easier or worse off if we get to spend more time together” i didn’t understand this so i asked him to explain and he said, “by the cost i mean how hard it would be to try to resolve those things, either it's easier because we're in person and we have more bonding and it works out better, or it's harder because we're in person and we can't escape the fight and it boils over worse, or other unpredictable reasons for either side. the benefit would be less if it's harder to resolve bc then the entire relationship is probably doomed. the benefit is greater if it's easy bc then the relationship would work well.” to me it’s very difficult to understand his doubts. i don’t know why but i don’t think much about things going badly like he does. i know it’s a possibility but at the same time i’m not afraid that that’s how things will go. i must say that everyone i know hasn’t divorced so i don’t know what he must have seen growing up. he says this, “i must clarify my doubts are not about how i feel for you right now, they're about the logistics of going farther into the relationship, the monumental next necessary step, and they're born out of fear from seeing basically every relationship i've ever witnessed in my life completely fall apart” even though he says that, this whole impasse about possibly breaking up rests very heavy on my heart. a part of me thinks he is just prolonging a relationship that he’s already decided on not pursuing, but he says that’s not the case. he thanks me for my patience and that he needs some space to think about what he wants to do here. do you have any words of advice for us? for me?",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,6.0,0.007471980074719801,0.0012453300124533001,0.0759651307596513,4.0,0.0

"what can i do about my boyfriends laid back approach to everything? my (21f) boyfriend (23m) have been together a year. we’ve both always been pretty laid back with things, but after this long sometimes his lack of effort or thought just seems like he’s not bothering with me as much as i feel like i deserve. there’s lots of things, he always runs late (i do too, but his late is several hours, mines usually 20 mins at most). when he is supposed to meet me at a certain time, he won’t tell me specifics of where he actually is. usually he’ll give me a list of things he needs to do before he can leave when he’s already late. which is okay, but he only works 2 days a week and does nothing else the rest of the week, so surely he would do those things on the days he’s doing nothing? he won’t even set alarms in the morning. so he wakes up when he wakes up. even with plans. he also never makes plans for us, i always have to plan our dates and pay for most things as he doesn’t have money ( he has money issues right now, but still spends over a hundred £ a week on 🍃). surely if you had to chose between that or getting the train to see your gf to make the plans she made, you would chose the gf. he’s only taken me on one date in the whole year i’ve been with him. he also kind of takes his frustrations out on me about that stuff. rarely, but it’s always been at me. another situation that was recent was that he told me he was going to come see me to give me my presents in a few days, (i work most days in the week and i’m also a student, so i brought his presents after i’d finished a long shift before going home). today he told me, that he slept in (he works late two days in a row). so he usually does sleep in on these days. but apparently he’d decided that today would be the day of the week he’d wake up early to buy my presents (after working till 2am) and starting another shift the same day. instead of the 5 other days of the week that he doesn’t have anything on but being at home. due to him waking up so late, he couldn’t buy me my presents this year. i’ve spoken to him about this stuff quite a lot, he agree and says he’ll do better. but he never seems to actually try. so i don’t want to keep nagging at him about these things. but i just want him to make some more effort with me. the same way i feel i do for him. this is my first proper relationship. what can i do about this?",advice,0,2404.0,504.0,1.0,0.001984126984126984,0.003968253968253968,0.07539682539682539,3.0,0.0

"my friend and her bf are walking all over me i (19f) share a flat with my friend (19f), she’s recently got a new bf (19m) who’s over a lot even when she’s not in since she gives him her key while she’s at work. i was never asked if it was okay for him to be there on his own but now i feel like it’s too late to say anything since it’s been going on for a few months. i’m not 100% on the idea he’s there on his own especially since they’ve only been dating a few months and so i have no reason to trust him i hardly know him but that’s the least of the problems now. we each have our own toilet, mine is in the main hallway and hers is an en-suite, even though mine isn’t it’s very clear it’s my toilet (even has a sign) and so i am obviously in charge of cleaning it which i do a lot it’s always spotless. therefore i noticed straight away when my toilet brush was covered (i can’t even explain how bad it was) in poo. and my toilet had clearly been very very used. this kept happening and so i confronted my flatmate and just asked her if she knew anything about it. she said she didn’t know why it would be that way and blamed it on her boyfriend and said she’d speak to him about it and so i left it at that. this toilet factor is important later. as i mentioned before i’m hardly at the flat during the day on weekdays due to uni hours but i happened to be there a few days ago with my flatmate. her boyfriend buzzed the flat to be let in and so she let him in but 4 other men walked in with him. my flatmate told me that she had no idea he was even coming over let alone all these men who i’d never seen before in my life. i felt a little disrespected since he didn’t even ask my flatmate (his gf) if he could bring these men into her house and turn up unannounced so after they had left i told her i wasn’t comfortable with people being at the property without both of us knowing. once again she said she’d talk to him about it. yesterday was the last straw, uni term just finished and so i was at the flat during the day again, i was home alone since my flatmate was at work and i was about to have a shower when about 6 men just enter my flat, her boyfriend leading them in. he stopped as soon as he saw me and was like “i know this looks bad” clearly startled that i was actually home and told his friends to go back outside. he left without saying a word to me. i was due to catch a train back home for christmas in the next hour and couldn’t stay to talk to my flatmate in person so i sent her a text explaining the situation and how uncomfortable it makes me which she ignored. i have my suspicions that this and the fact my toilet keeps getting destroyed are connected. i think he’s been bringing his friends over to our flat without my knowledge for a while now. so my question is how on earth do i approach this?? do i even have any right to do anything since they’re using her keys so are they her guests?? it makes me so uncomfortable i don’t know what to do. if they steal something i don’t think i can claim on insurance since they technically didn’t break in. i feel like this is going to completely ruin our friendship",advice,0,3140.0,661.0,6.0,0.009077155824508321,0.0015128593040847202,0.09682299546142209,4.0,0.0
"i think i have outgrown my wife? hi all, i'm using this medium to honestly just vent and express myself, kinda like putting my thoughts to the universe. your opinions and advice are welcome of course. i just literary don't have friends. tl:dr op has provided the wife with a comfortable lifestyle that the wife has not grown professionally or matured which is distress in the household. ========================================= my wife [31f] and i [33m] have been married for 6 years, before that we were in a relationship for well over a decade. we have two young boys, a 5-year-old and a 7-month-old. relevant to the ""story"" of our education is the following: my wife has an associate's degree in liberal arts and i have an unfinished bachelor's degree in computer science. additionally, i come from your typical working-class family, and my wife came from a poor single-mom household. before my boys were born my wife has been working for the same retail store for years, i've always encouraged her to make use of her associate's degree in a better-paying job or return to school to finish a degree. her response has always been ""i don't know what i want "" and we left it at that. in the meanwhile, i've always been searching for better job opportunities whether it meant going up the corporate ladder or finding a new job entirely. financial speaking we always have been able to make meet ends. of course, that all changed when our firstborn came into our life, my goal then has been to find better pay than the years past and i have grown considerably professionally that i was finally able to find a $40k job. in the meantime, my wife has stayed working for the same retail store, in similar roles, for roughly $30k a year. by the time my secondborn came into our lives, i have taken that $40k and turn into a $52k job, and again, no significant change for my wife. the year 2022 has proven extremely difficult for working families here in the usa. we almost lost our home due to the exaggerated increase in property tax, and our monthly mortgage had increased by $1,100.00. it took me 2 days to finally gather my marbles to figure out a way to reduce that without selling the home or getting into an expensive loan. in the meantime, my wife was just telling me, ""we will be ok"", and ""we will figure it out"". i was so mentally unwell, that it began to manifest physically. i still feel like a failure because in my mind i think that had i been smarter and finished my degree i would not have found myself in this situation of almost losing the house. then i began thinking even more, why am i the only one so interested in finding better pay for my family? i now feel like, my stress and sacrifices have provided my wife with such a comfortable life that she just doesn't seem to care about progressing financially and professionally. worse is that in part of reducing expenses we agreed that she would have to only work on the weekends so that on the weekdays she could stay with the kids to cut on daycare expenses. you would think that the house would be clean right? no. i do more house cleaning on a saturday than she does in the entire week. while taking care of the kids. now i'm exhausted, as a father, as a husband, as a professional. i've gained a lot of weight, recently i had to double on heart meds. i've been begging my wife for a little more support that never comes. and it is causing me to think of a path in which she is not involved but for my kid's sake, i haven't taken any action. i honestly feel like this stress is going to cancel my life subscription if i leave it unchecked. in my eyes, my wife remains like the same 16-year-old girl when we first met, but in the body of a 31 years woman, tossing all responsibility to me. she is a wonderful mother, i can't deny that. but she fears change so much that is hurting us. i know that some families operated under this premise. man is the head of the household and the sole provider. but that is not how i want to raise my boys. i want them to understand that women are more than just mothers or objects. and during our relationship with my wife, we made it clear how we wanted to raise our family. i just reach a point now where i am lost and extremely unhealthy, not to mention unhappy. ===================================== ok there. i got that out of my chest. again, opinions are always welcome and any advice will be taken to heart and consideration.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,4.0,0.004920049200492005,0.006150061500615006,0.0996309963099631,3.0,0.0

"how to handle parents divorce for young adult in their mid 20s ? right now that's pretty much what's happening in my life, i don't think i'm allowing myself to feel everything, my emotions and clearly realizing what is happening. my parents obviously don't love each other anymore, the fault is more on my father side (or considerably more on his side). i wasn't at my familial home since half a year so i don't know what took place (last year they went through a divorce situation but were able to talk it out and deal with it, although i thought). so he's at war with pretty much everyone, they described a behavior pattern i've recognized from the past so with all they've presented to me it makes sense. he had his second chance, i thought after their long and complicated initial argument about divorce everything would work out for them and for us. guess it can't work. on my side i obviously don't want to see my close family being fractured, but it seems clear that he's the bad person in all this commotion. he's been a dick to my little brother (then again i wasn't there so i might not know some little details, but he's out of control) who is going through rough times, saying mean hurtful things. in public he keeps a façade. some of his colleague from his previous affectation were informed by my mother and even him was under shock and very disappointed in my dad's behavior. he intends to leave us and find happiness in his life. my brother told him that if he were to leave he'd cut every bridge and never see him again. my mother basically says that he can't just go away and shriek from his responsibilities for some women (which on that i agree). they've been married for 30 years. even tho he's being an asshole, having the family dynamic destroyed like that won't leave me indifferent, because most of my life i used to love him, i think i still do. it's gonna hit hard emotionally in a few month max i anticipate from myself. it seems most of my family dealt with some of their emotions before i did. pitfalls i could avoid ? way to deal with it internally ? thanks again",advice,0,2094.0,384.0,6.0,0.015625,0.005208333333333333,0.0859375,3.0,0.0
"boyfriend thinks i’m toxic for this reason.. me [27f] and my boyfriend [28m] have been dating almost 10 years. my biggest concern with him is the lack of effort in our relationship regarding spending time with me. we walk the dog together once a day 30 minutes to an hour, and that’s about all the quality time we’ve had in a very long time. the rest of his day is spent working and then video games, averaging atleast 5-8 hours a day. we don’t do anything on the weekends and all i’ve asked for is more quality time. for the first time in over a year he agreed to paint with me last night, where we would switch the canvas every 5 minutes. i went to his room and told him to come get me when he was ready. i waited 4 hours until i noticed he just wasn’t going to do it. so i went to get him. i asked to help me pick out some paint colors and instead he went downstairs (still playing his video game) and told me to do it. this upset me. we were supposed to do it together and instead he put it all on me, which took atleast 30 minutes for me to do alone. it would have taken 10 minutes with his help. at this point, it’s 11 o’clock and i’m sad that it’s already ruined. we’re both in a bad mood but i tried turning it around while we painted. he didn’t speak to me the entire time. half way through, he got a stomach ache, so we stopped and he continued his gaming. no discussion was had since he wasn’t feeling well and he just avoided it when i brought it up in the moment anyways. we go to bed, i get over it because i’m just happy he made an effort and i wake up determined to have a good day and be in a good mood. just now- driving to get food and he’s obviously upset. i ask what i did wrong and he gets frustrated telling me i’m not healthy and the fact that i woke up happy after getting upset with him last night is sickening. calls me bipolar and says it’s my fault and he doesn’t like hanging out with me. mind you, that all i’ve asked for years is quality time and instead he just chooses to play games and does not come to me with things he’d like to do with me. i can’t sit in bed and wait on him to give me his time anymore. i got frustrated after i got excited that he finally said yes to doing something with me and instead made me do half of it alone and then stopped half way and just played his video games. i’ve clearly communicated this several times and now i just don’t know what to do.",advice,0,2412.0,502.0,1.0,0.00199203187250996,-0.00199203187250996,0.10756972111553785,0.0,0.0

"i need relationship advice first i apologize for my bad english for context we are in a long distance relationship which has worked out for the longest time and have been really lovey-dovey and sends me every morning a good morning text and a good night one in the evening which we kept doing until one day. she was the nicest cutest and most adorable girl i could have ever ask for, be it personality or looks she was in every way perfect to me. also this is my 2nd relationship so where shall i start? i ( 22 m ) have been with my gf ( 19f ) together for a year, basically she moved to a new place and found some new friends which im really happy for and is adapting quite nicely. one of her friends lets call him mark has been very nice towards her and i have a bad feeling. so ever since they got to know each other she has been ignoring me more and more and prefers to spend time with him instead of calling me, which is totally understandable since real life interactions are better. i just feel so miserable i dont get any more good morning texts or good night texts unless i initiate the convo and tell her im going to sleep and wish her a good night. the issue really is that i have recently found out ( i stumbled across it by accident ) that she is lying to me whenever she says she is tired or whatnot excuse she has ready cause whenever i ask if we can talk she brings up an excuse but is at the same time playing with mark and in a call with him. this really hurts me, i would rather get an honest opinion on why she is lying but i have asked multiple time and i never got a proper answer, also its really hard for me to fully trust her when she is lying about small things like these. she broke the news to me she is moving to another continent for a year or so ( transfer stuff ), i told her waiting for her wont be a problem for me but lately shes been insisting that she doesnt want me to wait cause "" i shouldnt miss out on a chance for a new girl "" for the sake of waiting for her, now i really dont care sacrificing that if it means that i can stay with her. i dont know if my mind is playing with me and telling me that my gf and mark have something going on, i really wanna trust her but like i mentioned its getting harder and harder to do so. i dont really know how to describe it but i feel like she just ripped my heart out and crushed it, ignoring my messages and answering a day or two later ( basically when she is not spending time with mark ) i dont know how she feels but i would say i put alot of effort into this realationship and i really love her and she used to show me all the affection and love back at the start of it, but now the only thing i see is a cold shoulder. i dont know, i feel devistated i dont know what to do i feel like its my fault but whenever i ask her she says its not. where have i failed? i really get more depressed the more days go by and i try to keep up the happy guy whenever i see or call her. i heart aches whenever i think about this topic and many people might call me a failure but i cried several nights on my own not knowing what to do, i feel sad, abandoned, emotionally crushed i dont wanna live like this, i would rather just ... thanks for reading it to the end, and let me know what ur thoughts are",advice,0,3276.0,659.0,1.0,0.0015174506828528073,0.012139605462822459,0.10773899848254932,2.0,0.0

"advice on helping my partner with his anger throwaway account and i’m not sure what to put here that would be relevant and helpful so if there’s anything i leave out that you want to know please feel free to ask and i will do my best to answer!! also i may not word stuff perfectly , i’m quite emotional over this so feel free to ask me to clarify if something doesn’t make sense or i sound mean and like i blame him entirely!! essentially my partner is just incredibly mean when he’s angry. he doesn’t remember all the things he says, and often tells me what he does say he said wrong or didn’t actually mean. it’s been getting worse recently and i genuinely have no idea what to do anymore. i’m 22f and he is 24m, we’ve been together for two and a half years, we’ve been engaged since february. we live with my family due to some problems that happened last year that made his living situation unsafe. when he’s angry he often calls me names (stupid, crazy, liar etc.) which he takes back once he’s calmed down. he doesn’t really hit things, he only has maybe four times our entire relationship, and never near me and never has he laid even a finger on me. he yells a lot, which we’ve talked about as i have ptsd and yelling is really triggering for me, so he’s tried to stop and he was better for a while but it’s getting worse again. he will say things just to hurt me, he blames me for framing him as the bad guy, he’s even said he doesn’t know why he’s with me while he was angry. he always takes it back, but lately it can go half a day before he calms down, even over night. i’ve asked about therapy but he’s not ready (which i completely understand, i’m in therapy and it’s definitely not something that’s easy and i do firmly believe it doesn’t help unless you’re ready), i’ve tried to find ways for him to express his anger like a punching bag, working out, art, even offering to buy those masks for musical actors they use to sing with so he could scream as loud as he wants and not worry. i’ve tried giving him alternative ways to communicate with me like texting me, texting me a code emoji so i know he needs time, hand signals, code words everything i can think of. i’m at my wits end.. i love him and i know this isn’t easy for him i know he just needs help, he’s not a bad person, i just don’t know what to do anymore. i hâte saying this because i feel like it’s dramatic or inflammatory, but i’m scared sometimes. to clarify i am not afraid he will hit me, he has never done anything that tells me this is abuse or that he would abuse me, i have been in several abusive relationships before, physical and emotional, and i’m in therapy for the results of those relationships. this is not him being abusive, but i am starting to wonder if we can’t be together because of it. i’m scared to cry because it makes him angrier, i’m scared to talk about how i feel because he always says i’m just making him the bad guy even when i say i wasn’t perfect and i want to talk about what i did wrong, just after i’ve had the chance to express how i feel. i’m scared to even try and take responsibility because when i do he says i’m just trying to take the smallest amount possible and actually blame him. (that happened when i started a conversation when he had been drinking and i hadn’t, so i told him i thought we should stop because i was wrong to start it and not consider that he was intoxicated and it was unfair of me to try and have a conversation when we weren’t on an equal playing field, he said that was me blaming him for being drunk.) he always apologizes later, and we’ve talked a lot recently about how i’m scared to engage with him because of how bad his anger has been. when he’s not angry he agrees with me and tells me we can figure it out, and he tells me that i am trying hard enough i do apologize and he just gets so angry he lashes out and says i don’t and tells me i’m not trying hard enough but it’s not true. i ask him all the time now because i don’t know what’s true and what isn’t anymore, i don’t even know how to avoid making him angry anymore. i will say that i have been worse too, i’ve had three funerals in the last four months alone not to mention the hundred other problems life has been dumping on my family. i have had much less patience and i’m really emotional all the time. i’ve been trying to manage it but i’m pretty empty on the emotional capacity front which hasn’t made things easier. i talked with him about that and how i have given him a lot of forgiveness throughout our relationship in relation to his anger and now i need him to have more patience for me. i’m autistic and have adhd so i already struggle with emotional disregulation, which has only gotten worse as school and life and funerals have started piling up on me. i truly don’t know what to do anymore, so please if you have advice on how to cope with anger whether it be for my partner to be less angry or for me to handle it all better when he is i would be endlessly appreciative for your thoughts. tldr; my partner is angry all the time and mean when he’s angry, how do i help him manage his anger or how can i cope better with it when he is angry??",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,2.0,0.0018656716417910447,-0.007462686567164179,0.10727611940298508,2.0,0.0

"my (34m) ex-employee (18f) is in a bad situation and i want to help her get out of it. i need your help, reddit. i am a 34 year old man. i have been a store manager at a seasonal place the past couple of years and i had an employee last year (i'll call her sally) that would say things in passing that caused me to become more and more concerned about her family life. concerned enough to leave an impact. however, she was 17 at the time and i didn't know how to approach the situation and kept telling myself it was none of my business, so i just kind of coasted through it until the season ended and that was that. well, i returned again this year and so did she. at first it seemed like things might have been getting better for her, but then i started noticing those red flags popping up again. she started to be more open with me as the season went on and once it ended she wanted to stay in contact. we have talked a lot now and, needless to say, i am very concerned for her. her father is absent and she lives with her mother in a one bedroom apartment where she attends school online and basically never leaves. honestly, i would have been surprised her mom allowed her to go out and get a job except that i know they aren't super financially stable and she needed the extra money. sally suffers from anxiety and depression and her hyper-religious mother believes that only god and jesus can make those things go away. by some miracle her mom lets her go to a therapist and get medication, so there is that one good thing, but she has told me multiple times that her mother doesn't like that she actually takes the meds and tries to get her not to, so much that sally often has to sneak them if she doesn't want her mom giving her shit about it. her mom is very manipulative and constantly gaslights her and blames her for having mental health issues. she guilts sally for the medical bills she's had to pay for her. she doesn't let sally have any hobbies or even watch movies or tv and has made her throw away a majority of her 'non-essential' possessions on multiple occasions, including again today. and the list goes on. it's killing me to just sit here and watch while all of this is happening to her, so this is where i need advice. is there even anything i can do? sally is 18 now, so legally she could leave her mother at any point, but i don't know how that would be possible. she still has one last semester of school, but i don't know how it works online. i don't know if her mom pays for it or if leaving her household would have any effect on if she could continue to attend. she also doesn't have any other family she has contact with, so i don't know where she would go. i know she wants to be out, but i also think the uncertainty could scare her so much she might not have the strength to leave. or she will think she deserves to be in this situation. her mom is also becoming suspicious of our friendship, which, between a 34 year old man and an 18 year old girl i obviously completely understand, but it's making it harder for me to have the opportunity to even approach this subject with sally. i honestly don't think she knows she can legally leave now. she told me at the end of the season that she wanted to keep in touch with me because i'm the only person who has ever showed her kindness and it fucking breaks my heart. i just want to know if there's anything at all i can do to help her. &#x200b; tldr; i (34m) have an ex-employee (18f) in a bad situation at home and want to know if there's anything i can do to help get her out of it.",advice,0,3571.0,687.0,7.5,0.012949640287769784,0.004316546762589928,0.05467625899280575,1.0,0.0

"i (20m) have been maintaining a close healthy relationship with my ex (19f) and i feel her friend is trying to negatively impact it my ex and i dated for over a year and lived together for 6 months, and she’s had a friend (21f) for most of that time we spent living together that i have never liked but always been very respectful towards her even when she has been wildly rude and disrespectful to me. as an example to the disrespect i’ve received from her, i have been cussed out for asking the friend to keep her voice down during quiet hours in our apartment, she tried to push marijuana use on my ex relentlessly even though she didn’t want to use it, she has mocked me and rubbed it in my face that i’m no longer with my ex (somewhat recent breakup), and has loudly expressed her anger at me in inappropriate ways at work for very little things in front of all of our coworkers. my ex and i have been maintaining consistent contact and have talked a little bit about getting back together, but certainly taking some time for ourselves, and we have been able to maintain a friendship as well. the other night my ex was hanging out with the above mentioned friend and suddenly wasn’t open to talk about things she and i have been talking about regularly since the breakup, and even raised her voice at me over the phone for expressing my care for her as a person. my ex is talking to me more already now that she isn’t hanging out with this friend, but it still hasn’t went back to normal entirely and i feel like the prospect of my ex and i getting back together may have went out the window as a result of the advice she received from her friend. i dearly love my ex, and i’ve been making countless efforts to be a very good partner for the future, such as cutting down my contact with female friends to prove that my ex is a high priority in my life, i’ve completed my personal trainer certification so i can get a better job so that if my ex and i got back together i’d be a more put together, driven man with a career he cares about and money to provide for her, and of course i’m trying to be there for her as much as she needs me to be in ways that i failed to be leading up to the breakup. i am scared that no matter the progress i have made as a person, my ex will succumb to the advice of her friend to just close things off even though everything between the two of us has been going very well. what can i do to encourage my ex to think about this on her own and go back to taking her time to make the choice that she wants without the influence of her immature and rude friend who has always been a bad influence and tried to encourage her to do things that she doesn’t want?",advice,0,2691.0,538.0,7.5,0.03717472118959108,0.007434944237918215,0.09479553903345725,1.0,0.0
"my girlfriends ex keeps contacting her. what do you think? first of all sorry for the long post. my(m25) girlfriend(f22) broke up with her ex in the spring of this year. we’ve been together since about the middle of august. in the time we’ve been together, her ex has contacted 4 or 5 times. the first time he was asking if they could hang out or something and she told him she was in a relationship. since then it has been meaningless surface level stuff in appearance. things like asking how shes doing or other questions that have no obvious point other than to keep making contact(this is all via text message if you see that as relevant). she always either gives a short reply with no follow up or doesn’t reply at all. i believe he’s just floating in the wind waiting for a chance and keeps testing the waters with these “innocent” messages. i’ve made this clear to my gf and her response is that i’m being insecure. it’s clear she’s not reciprocating and she always lets me know when he messages but i get an awful feeling about his intentions. i trust her but it bothers me that she doesn’t see what i see and brushes off my concerns. i feel as though there are two peoples desires involved. ex wants to keep talking to her vs i want ex to stop talking to her. she has the power to satisfy either his desire or mine and it seems like she’s riding the fence. she’s not reciprocal but she also won’t take any action to actually stop the thing that makes me uncomfortable. i just don’t know what to think",advice,0,1509.0,297.0,7.5,0.030303030303030304,0.003367003367003367,0.06397306397306397,1.0,0.0

"partner with bipolar hey guys, i come in peace here and i need advice. i've recently started a relationship with someone who has bipolar disorder: she's an amazing person, beautiful, passionate, caring, generous, sensitive, compassionate, loving and we have by far the best chemistry i've ever had in my life. the only issue is that i'm new to the condition and the experience of dealing with it. i know i love her and she loves me and i want to be there for her no matter what. thing is, at times she will say awful things to me, horrible things that are designed to hurt, and her personality will change from those traits aforementioned to someone very cold, calculating and sadistic. i've even asked her if she just wants to hurt me and she has said yes, but she doesn't know why. now, she has had trauma in her life before: abusive exes and even worse (which i will not go into here). regardless, i just want to be there for her. i can take the hurtful comments, i am strong and have also been fucked with on many occasions. what i can't take is her threatening to leave. i know she doesn't mean it (always), but it hurts so much. i have self harmed in the past in moments of great distress but now i find myself doing it more and more as a way to deal with the horrible pain. i'm a very affectionate person who craves physical contact (not sexual, just physical), and one of her go-to things to do when she's upset with me is to not allow me to touch her at all. it hurts so much because she's normally so welcoming of my affection, i panic and i feel lost and powerless and i don't know what to do. this inevitably results in a spiral of self-pity and she hates that too. it's the coldness that really bothers me though. i can be sat there in floods of tears, apologizing ad nauseam for any transgressions i have made, and she seems completely calm yet somehow vengeful. like she wants me to suffer, and to know why i should suffer. i've also done stupid and foolish things with her too, like threatening to slit my own throat if she leaves, which i know is toxic, stupid behaviour. i hate feeling that desperate. i just want her to be happy, and i want to be the one to make her happy. so the question is this: how much should i attribute to her condition, what can i do to improve and what advice would you give? i'm totally new to all this but i know i want to be with her, warts and all. she's perfect for me in every single way and it feels so much like i'm the one messing things up, or acting in ways i don't normally act, nor want to. &#x200b; any advice would be greatly appreciated.",advice,0,2598.0,499.0,4.0,0.008016032064128256,-0.004008016032064128,0.08016032064128256,1.0,0.0
"how to solve mutual distrust between me (21m) and partner (19f) so just some basic background—i’ve been dating my partner for almost 3 months (though we were best friends much longer before this). i caught them in a lie awhile ago that involved them meeting one of their current friends on a dating app and purposefully hiding that from me. they know i have some deeply ingrained trust issues from childhood trauma + being cheated on in multiple past relationships. though i know it’s never okay, i went through their phone about a month and a half later (during which i repeatedly brought up things i’d observed between her and this friend to which she always denied and made it a problem i needed to work on within myself) only to find out that they had lied to me about the fact that they had been flirting with this friend up until a week after we decided to be exclusive, and that their friend didn’t even know i existed until the end of that week. i found out a few other things they had been lying to me about concerning their relationship with this friend concurrent with our relationship, but they’re less significant so i’ll omit for time’s sake. we tried to work through it, agreeing that i wouldn’t violate their privacy like that again and she would work to be honest with me, on top of some other issues we addressed. things had been good and i’d been able to work on my trust in a really productive way. in fact, i felt fully secure and the happiest i’ve ever been in the relationship this past week. then i found out that she and her friends (including the one mentioned) had been planning a christmas party at our apt that i didn’t know about until it was too late to be a part of the secret santa or planning. this bugged me a little, but i decided it was small and didn’t matter so i tried to get over it. well the thing with me is that i fester, so i went through their phone again that night only to find out they were saying disrespectful things about me to the friend, and then deleting the texts. i brought this up and they lied to me and denied it until i physically showed them that i had seen the texts. when i brought up how this is something my exes had done with people they cheated on me with, they just ignored it. tl;dr: my trust in my partner has been undermined by a series of lies relating to a friend they may be flirting with behind my back early in our relationship and theirs in me has been undermined by my having gone through their phone multiple times after stating i wouldn’t do that again. how do we move forward? what if i’m afraid i can’t rebuild my trust in them? how do i rebuild their trust in me? how do i learn to be comfortable with their friendship with this person?",advice,0,2720.0,529.0,1.0,0.001890359168241966,0.005671077504725898,0.10964083175803403,4.0,0.0

""i've always loved you. i'm sorry, i didn't want you to find out like this but i love you."" wut. after years of being friends, her making it abundantly clear that she wanted nothing more from me than friendship, and now she tells me she loves me this whole time. i was dumbfounded. i just stayed quiet and let her talk. she said she never felt like she was enough for me. like she could never live up to my expectations of a partner. she'd understand if i hated her and never wanted to see or speak to her again. my mind was racing. i hadn't said much the whole ride home so when we were pulling up to her place she told me just to drop her off in front of her apartment complex and she'd walk the rest of the way. she was wasted and i wasn't about to do that so i finally spoke up and told her ""stop. i don't hate you. i love you. i just have a lot to think about. but i'm not gonna leave you alone after all this. let's just go inside and cuddle and talk about this."" so we did, as much as we could with her being drunk, and eventually we were both in a better mood. at one point she was laying with her head on my chest and i asked if i could kiss her, she said yes, and we did. it was great. well since then we hadn't talked too much about it all aside from her apologizing the following day and me telling her it was okay and i just had a lot to think about. so now we arrive at my dilemma. i obviously love this woman. but do i love her as my friend, or more? i've thought about her as my friend for so long, i'm really not sure. and i'd hate to try a relationship, have it not work, and it sours our friendship. i don't want to lose her. also (this may be shallow and i'm sorry but it's just a preference i can't control) she has gained quite a bit of weight over the last couple years. she's still beautiful, don't get me wrong. she will always be beautiful. but i'm just not sure if i'm sexually attracted to her. i want to be. i just don't know if that's something that would get better with time or not. the weight gain also may be due to a medical issue for which she is currently awaiting tests to discern, so it could change as well. but regardless, is this something i should bring up very gently when discussing our future together? i don't feel like it's something i should hide, but i also don't want to hurt her. i don't know. aside from those hangups, she would make a great partner. she loves my kids and they love her. we like a lot of the same movies and music, our religious and political views are identical, we have the same love language, etc. i'm just not sure what my next step should be. i never, in a million years, thought i'd be in this situation but here i am. and i'm so confused and unsure. what do you wonderful people think? should i throw caution to the wind and go for it considering our history would indicate we'd probably be a great couple, or should i just stay friends and not chance possible destruction? any advice would be greatly appreciated.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,2.0,0.001953125,0.0107421875,0.083984375,5.0,0.0

"i do wanna have sex with my best friend's boyfriend, and i think he wants it too! i'll try to be as clear as possible. english is not my first language so bear with me. i don't even know if this is the proper place to write this. it is my first time posting. i (m43) have been living abroad from the past 17 years. i came to live here on my own, so i have no family and i had to make new friends, which of course i have. one of them is my friend , let's call him john (m45). i absolutely love him. we have been friends for 10 years more or less and we have become very important for each other. i have been with him through important and difficult parts of his life and he has been my rock when i've been in need, especially emotional support. we have a very special relationship: we have been sexually intimate in the past, it happened several times and i loved it. we both always took it as some sort of bonding thing between us, but we have never been romantically interested in each other. our friendship has been probably more satisfying than a romantic relationship. even if we haven't been sexually intimate for a while, we use to kiss on the lips when we greet each other (i do that also with other friends as well). john has been on a relationship with a guy for the past year and a half, i think, let's call him peter (m36). he moved in recently with john, from another city, so he is in the process of making new friends and stuff like that, peter is a great guy, and also sexy. slowly we started to get to know each other, hanging out all together. for me it was important to be accepted by peter, considering how important john is to me. i was happy to see that peter was opening up with me. he soon was included on the list of friends i kiss when i greet them, let's put it this way. one day the three of us plus a common friend got really, really wasted... so we all ended up being, let's say, a lot friendlier with each other. it was super fun and cool, not proper full-package sex but sexual nonetheless. it was nothing new between me and john but for sure it was a new situation with peter and i realised that he was like, very much into it with me. it felt good because i didn't know he would be like that with me. of course we were very drunk, but i thought it was so nice that it happened, like we bonded more. a nice memory we created together. me and john talked about it and he said he was happy to see that me and peter were enjoying ourselves. after that day of course we felt more comfy with other. it happened a couple of times to hang out again , all of us, chilling on the couch watching a film and hugging, being touchy and stuff, just like i usually do with john. i must confess that i do feel attracted to peter, but after all, i do feel attracted to john as well, since ever, and we have carried on our friendship without a problem. i mean, there are a lot of people i feel attracted to in one way or another. a week ago john was out of town and peter asked me if we could have dinner together because he didn't want to be alone, and i agreed. we had food, a couple of beers, talked a lot about many things, having a great time. we were close to my place and wanted to go up to smoke some weed. we did and we started watching tv on the couch, his head lying on my chest, my arm around his torso. sometimes holding hands, caressing , nothing really compromising, at least in my head, but i could feel my heart beating faster and faster. the thing is that caressing intensified a bit more. we even kissed a couple of times, and hands were going places, still somehow innocent... then not that innocent anymore. at the beginning i felt ok with it but then i thought that maybe we were crossing some lines... just because john wasn't present. it was nothing that hasn't happened before between me and peter but... john was there as well, unlike this time. i'm sure peter was going at it so i kind of freaked out but i kept it cool. i asked him ""what about john?"" ""what about him?"" he said, so i said: ""well, i'm very happy to do whatever with you because i'm enjoying myself a lot, but i need to be sure that john is ok with it "" (john knew we were together that night, and maybe he was ok with something happening between us, but i just didn't know!). peter looked at me and said: ""yeah, maybe it is better if i go home. i need to wake up early tomorrow... but you know, everything is cool"". so we hugged and he left. i freaked out because i thought ""omg peter was about to cheat on john with me so i was about to betray my beloved friend, was i?!"". i didn't know if peter was going to tell john, if john was going to be mad about it, or maybe not. i was panicking! i cannot lose my friend. at the same time i didn't want that my bond with peter would go sour or become awkward because of this. i talked casually with john two days after and he was normal with me , and messaged with peter and he was normal as well. the thing is... damn, i really want this. it made me feel so good! it made me feel accepted, wanted (yeah, low self-steem issues here) and it was just beautiful to make such connection. i just wish that john would be ok with these situations, or he would be part of it if he wants to (that would be even better!). i just don't know how to ask if he is ok about it because it would mean to tell him what was going on that night between me and peter. i don't want to put peter in trouble and i don't want him to be angry at me... and even if me and peter would never be in a situation like this again... should i tell john about it anyway? i don't know how to behave. i'm glad that i was able to stop myself right before certain limit was about to be crossed. as you can see, i have a very ""free"" approach to sex and human relationships. i do think that sex is a great way to connect with people and sex among friends is great, on my book. this time, tho, i feel like i'm getting in trouble! any insight would be appreciated. tl;dr: i was about betray my best friend when his bf was about to cheat on him with me.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,2.0,0.0016652789342214821,0.005828476269775187,0.10407993338884262,4.0,0.0

"uncertainty in my relationship is making me feel sick me (m29) and my partner (f29) have been together since we were 24, five years. the beginning of the relationship was not ideal. i was at a point of extremely high confidence and she was at a point of very low confidence. i had recently come from a string of hookups that had me feeling like hot shit. we began hooking up and it almost felt as if i ‘fell into’ the relationship. at that time she was extremely quiet. we had incredible physical chemistry but i don’t think i had the proper feelings of ‘butterflies.’ i never thought to myself ‘oh my god im so lucky’ to be with this person. i’m a very social and artsy person and she is more introverted and enjoys the arts but not to the same degree as me. overtime i fell in love with her but this feeling of unease or uncertainty would pop up from time to time. sometimes i would find myself googling ‘how do i make myself love someone more’ or ‘uncertainty in relationships.’ i never really thought too seriously about breaking up but i was have fleeting thoughts about it or fleeting fantasies about being single again. the relationship got better and better. we moved in together and have been living together for 2.5 years. we have a lot of fun in our relationship and we’re constantly laughing. no one thinks i’m funnier than she does lol. i know that she loves me incredibly deeply. when i look up checklists of what a relationship needs to move forward with marriage we check every box. but these feelings of uncertainty began to bubble up in the past month in a more serious way. they began to make me feel sick. like i was keeping a big secret from the person i love the most. i was doing a lot of reading online about how you should feel about moving into marriage with your partner and i read something that said moving into marriage you should feel ‘fuck yeah’ and not ‘yeah.’ and i only felt ‘yeah’ so we had a conversation and i told her about my ongoing uncertainty and how i feel ‘yeah’ but not ‘fuck yeah’ about our future. this conversation was supposed to be about us working on our relationship but it ended with her proposing the question that we break up and i didn’t fight it. in that moment i felt that if we didn’t break up then i would end up breaking up with her later. i spent two days discussing it with my friend who thought i made the right choice. i discussed all the problems. i was extremely sad. other people i talked to about it were less certain about my decision. as i voiced all my concerns about the relationship the problems began to feel trivial. i recognized that no one is perfect and all these small things don’t matter much. there were these small things that could have been conversations. so i started to reframe my thoughts to think about how it could work if we move forward together. the sadness disappeared and was replaced by knots in my stomach. the same feelings i had that led to me having this conversation in the first place. i’m afraid that maybe i don’t love her enough? even though everything mostly seems good on paper there is this ineffable uncertainity i can’t shake. i’m afraid that this uncertainty might be coming from this unrealistic adolescent fantasy of what my life was ‘supposed’ to be like. i’m also facing a lot of uncertainity in the other aspects of my life right now. some of my closest friends have begun to really piss me off. and the career i’ve been working towards seems like it might not happen. perhaps these other uncertainities i’m just taking out on her? it comes down to the fact that when i think about cotinuing with her i have crazy stomach pain. like my body is telling me it isn’t right. but we didn’t get this far for no reason. the day to day is really good. i’m afraid that if we get back together i’ll still feel this way after working on our problems and break her heart again. i’m just deeply confused. if you read all this thank you.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,6.0,0.008021390374331552,0.008021390374331552,0.11497326203208556,2.0,0.0

"i'm seeing my so fall into a depression for the first time and am at a loss on how to help throwaway account btw. english isn't my first language! excuse any mistakes, cheers my so (28) and i (32) have been together for 5 years now. known each other for 7. for as long as i know my so, he has been an incredibly optimistic and genuinely happy guy. sure he would have some ups and downs, but i really mean it when i say that he has always been happy. this is a guy who can find the silver lining in anything, pure sunshine, extremely extroverted. in our relationship, i've always been the slightly more mentally unstable one. when we first started going out, i was deep in the depression and this guy pulled me out far enough to let me get my feet on the ground. we were barely a few months into the relationship and he would go out of his way to help me do even the simplest tasks. we always had a bit of a bumpy road ahead of us, queer couple, traditional parents, both of us immigrants. tough but somehow we scraped by, got our shit together, figured life out. throughout all i've never seen him fall so far down in terms of mental health. not when our parents bickered between each other because of nationality and made both of our lives living hell for a year or so at the beginning. not when our close friend passed away a year or so ago. a few weeks ago i started noticing a shift in him. he works from home, so he's taken it upon him to handle cooking. (also probably because i've gotten both of us sick with food poisoning twice). but he also always seemed to truly enjoy it. he's almost stopped cooking fully, claiming he's not in the mood to do it. which is fine by itself, i don't mind, the problem is so many of his usual habits he's dropped. he doesn't go to the gym anymore (something i've never seen him skip), he doesn't go hang out with his friends, i haven't even seen him play video games which is something he's always really enjoyed. by the time i get home (albeit it's usually quite late, typically 7 or 8 pm), he's already in bed, more often sleeping. i don't even see him working on his pottery projects, which has always been his passion i'm really worried. i've tried doing the things he did for me when i was really bad mentally, helping him eat well, making sure he's taking care of his hygiene, keeping the apartment clean so that he's not spending his time in filth. i've tried talking to him about maybe seeing a therapist but he claims he doesn't need it, that everything is fine and he's just tired. i don't know if he's trying to fool me, but when you know someone as well as we know each other you can tell when something is wrong. i've tried talking to his sister, trying to see if she maybe knew something that i didn't. but between the two of us, we couldn't figure out anything had happened. she's thinking that he might be using drugs again, which i'm not too sure on. i know if college he used to use a lot at parties and such, but as far as i know (and have been told) it was never addiction levels and i haven't really seen him take any drugs in recent memory. his birthday is coming up, and this morning he told me he doesn't want to celebrate at all and to just treat it like a normal day. again, all these things individually aren't alarming, it's all of them together added tot he fact that i know what he usually is makes me incredibly worried. the irony is, i've been where he is, i should know how to help. but i'm lost. i'm not sure on how help at this point. he's completely shut down and shut me out. i feel like all i can do is try to keep him physically healthy, but it doesn't feel like enough tldr: i'm certain my so is depressed but i don't know why, or what triggered this, or even how to really help him",advice,0,3763.0,687.0,0.0,0.0,0.004160887656033287,0.06934812760055478,0.0,0.0

"can’t make it work with asexual woman anymore i (23m) have been dating an asexual woman (22f) for a a little over a year and i’m just not sure i can take it anymore. i love this woman more than anything and i desperately want to make this work so we can spend our lives together, but i’m just so tired and frustrated of feeling alone in my sexuality. three months into our relationship she told me she was asexual, but still enjoyed sex to some degree. i have a fairly high libido and would prefer to have sex a couple time a week but she would be more content with once or twice a month. we do have sex once a week plus she’ll let me jerk myself off while eating her out in lieu of sex but it’s usually because i initiate and i just feel so gross because i can tell she’s only doing it for me and it just takes me out of my head and makes the act depressing. i’ve tried to come up with sex acts that don’t involve actual penetration such as her dominating me but she shoots me down and just doesn’t want to work with me to find some kind of solution. she claims to enjoy sex and has on many occasions initiated it which is frustrating because of the unpredictability aspect. i feel like my sexual side is just something she wants to sweep under the rug and not acknowledge. when she tells me how handsome and sexy i am i just feel like a museum piece, not a desired romantic partner. i just can’t stop fantasizing about being with someone that wants me the same way i want her. i just don’t know what to do. i love this girl so much and this past year has been the greatest year of my life. we share so many passions and have great conversations, she is my best friend and i want her in my life forever. i’m just worried we’ve reached a barrier that can’t be overcome. we will both graduate college in a few and will move in together. i’d imagine that this would plummet our sex life even more due to familiarity. i am just desperate for some kind of solution. maybe i am just a selfish asshole. any serious advice is appreciated.",advice,0,2031.0,411.0,0.0,0.0,0.009732360097323601,0.11192214111922141,0.0,0.0

"how does it sound like courtship is going? 31m, 27f hi everyone, tldr; i'm 31 years old, single for about six months now and have been casually someone i met off of an app since late october. things have generally going well, currently the woman i am seeing lives about 60 miles north of me in new york. due to this, i haven't been able to see her as often as i'd like (i just went on my third date with her last night), however we remain in basically daily communication since i have met her. the first date was in early october, went very well, and she texted me how she had a great time and would like to get together again as i was driving home within the first hour after leaving her (i made sure to kiss her on the lips before departing). the second date, i took her to brunch, and then axe throwing, where we went drinking, threw axes and did other things. she also texted me that she had a great time within an hour after seeing her. last night i saw her again, it was snowing, i took her to get sushi, and we went to a fun place that had live music, arcade games, bowling, axe throwing (i didnt try to throw axes again but it was her idea, and it's rural in upstate ny so its difficult to get a lot of fun plans in winter up there). i believe the date last night went well, she texted me after leaving again within the first hour, telling me she had a good time, and how she wasn't looking forward to me going on a long vacation (i am going to miami for 2 weeks this friday). also to note, when i was departing with her, we made out in my car for 2 - 3 minutes, where she put her tongue into my mouth (i think this is a good sign). she also held hands with me, and we've playfully flirted with one another, she even laughs at my semi-corny jokes. part of the reason i have not seen her as much is because she lives with her mom, however she bought an apartment in nyc and is moving in next month. i currently moved back in with my parents after ending a 5 year relationship, so living here for the winter and then moving into nyc in april to sign a new lease. she seems okay with this really, and hasn't really shown any signs of disinterest due to me living with my parents. however, she did indicate she doesn't really introduce guys to her family until she's been with them a while (fine, i get it, same way here with women). i know not to get all caught up on one woman, so i have still been on apps, going out, dating during the week. i have dated other women during the week, she has gone out during the week, less than me, i suspect maybe shes been on a few dates but dont know for sure, but absolutely know for sure and know better to not ask her, and to give her space. this girl texts me during the day every single day, and its rare i go an entire day without hearing from her. i make sure i don't respond immediately, sometimes a few hours can go by or an hour or two between responses. she initiates i would say maybe 60 - 70% of the contact, asks me questions, and generally there is not a day that goes by that i do not hear from her. i don't really have any concerns as things are going where they are, and i know not to get caught up on one girl, which is why i'm dating other women, however i really do like this girl. my thinking as of this point is continue to take her out, show her a good time, have fun, hang out , hook up, rinse and repeat until she brings up the discussion of being ""exclusive."" i find that men who do best are generally working on being the best version of themselves and everything else follows. again, the only challenges at this point it appears are really have been she lives with her parents, i live with my parents, although we both work jobs making six figures, she is moving out next month (she has already said we can have dinners together in her new apartment and sleep over, cuddle and make out on couch, etc). thankfully, i am moving out april 1st, so its not terrible. also to my surprise, last week when she went out and got drunk with friends in the city, she told me i should be more aggressive with her in terms of just grabbing her and making out going forward, so i started doing that last night, although i was careful not to go too far as much as i wanted to start feeling her up in the car (maybe ill venture into that territory next date?) how does it sound like things are going overall? i'm assuming the fact she texted me last night again within an hour regardless of the topic after of me leaving, put her tongue in my mouth, still texting me today and reaching out to me, asking me questions, etc is a good sign? i would be exclusive with her but i will not ever bring this up, i am under the impression this may eventually come up from her after a few more months of hanging out, dating, having fun and hooking up, especially with her now closer to me in her new apartment, and then me moving out shortly thereafter. does anyone have any feedback or guidance to give me overall? i find that women tend to like men the most, when you give them space, are not clingy, let them come to you (women cannot dump you if you can get to a position where they are the ones chasing you). i do not to mess it up with this girl, and truthfully, really like her. does it sound like she likes me too? i am assuming if she liked me a lot she wouldn't be texting me so quickly after dates, among other things? happy holidays and thanks for your advice in advance!",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,4.0,0.003780718336483932,0.005671077504725898,0.07750472589792061,5.0,0.0

"she can't get over him my current gf (23f) had a thing with a man twice her age about a year ago, before we met. she still can't get over him, and she refuses to go no contact with him as she believes it would destroy her. she believes he was the only real love of her life, and she still adores him like crazy, but she can't be with him because he's married. she says she loves me, we spend nearly all of our time together and never fight or have heated arguments. we fit each other nearly perfectly. however, she's constantly living in his memory, either comparing stuff i do to what he used to do (whether good or bad), or randomly zoning out, remembering him. i had a rule in my life that i would never allow myself to be in such a position of comparison. i would never allow myself to be a substitute, a 2nd choice. but i broke this rule and i don't know what to do. on one hand, i love her unconditionally and i would gladly take not 1 but 10 bullets for her. on the other hand, she doesn't reciprocate the same kind of feelings. i don't even understand what it means. she says she loves me, but she loves him too. she loves him in a very special way, she says. but she loves me just like she loves her female friends. the only difference is that i'm a man, and she's sexually attracted to me. she also says we're the prettiest sexiest couple she's ever seen. it sounds like a fwb position, but the way she acts is even more confusing. what is this? i'm unable to understand, nor am i able to figure out who the hell am i to her. i feel like i'm being used to fill a void. i feel unworthy. i feel absolutely like dogshit. i should leave, but i cannot get myself to do it. i should tell her it's either me or him, but i'm afraid of the answer i know very well. i'm heartbroken. she is the most gorgeous thing to ever happen to me, and the most hideous thing to ever happen to me.",advice,0,1884.0,372.0,5.0,0.013440860215053764,0.010752688172043012,0.08333333333333333,1.0,0.0

"ongoing grief in marriage tldr: my partner’s grief has been center stage for our entire relationship. not sure how to cope with it or if i can stay since they have not been able to emotionally support me during my own grieving as i have done for them. together going on 15 years. when i met my partner their mother, who i loved dearly, was sick with cancer. 6 years into our relationship she died. so almost 9 years ago. i’ve never expected that my partner will “get over it” and accept that grief is an ongoing and sometimes lifelong process. we have a sort of fairytale romance, teenage love, eloped a year in, and many people think of us as “couple goals”… but everyone doesn’t know everything and i won’t get all the way into our relationship history here. it hasn’t been all roses and rainbows, but we have a solid foundation of love. last year, 2 people in my family died, one by s•••••e, one by old age. i had a complicated relationship with my grandmother and lots of childhood trauma that was coming up. while i was grieving, my partner was not able to show up for me emotionally. i felt abandoned, though they tried their best, they were consumed with the grief of their mother and shifted the focus of conversations to processing that pain. it left me completely shell shocked to feel like all these years i have been their emotional support during their grief, but when i needed the same in return, i did not receive it. it shattered the trust i had. we have talked about this and my partner has apologized for not being able to be there during my time of need. fast forward to recently watching an episode of a show where the character’s grandmother died. at the end of the episode my partner started bawling and i instinctively held them while they cried. this lasted for a while, over 10 minutes. i know they were thinking of their mother. but it’s like they were completely oblivious to how i could be thinking of my grandmother who just died last year. once again i felt like i needed to be the strong and supportive partner with no space to express the pain i was also feeling in that moment. when they are feeling their grief, it feels like it supersedes everything in our life. along with our other problems, it makes trusting for the future so difficult. when the next person dies in one of our families (likely their grandma) i feel like everything will revolve around them processing the pain and it is just a never ending cycle. i don’t know what to do about it and the thought of this makes me want to leave before anyone else dies. my partner is resistant to therapy and does not really talk to anyone else about the grief, so i feel like it’s on me. i would love to hear other people’s experiences if they have gone through similar or just reflections and advice. thank you",advice,0,2800.0,522.0,3.0,0.005747126436781609,0.005747126436781609,0.09578544061302682,0.0,0.0

"my(f25) husband(m26) broke up with me and i need advice on how to move on basically what the title says. my (f25) husband(m26) broke up with me last night. we've been together for over 6 years, married only 5 months. he was my first everything basically. i still love him and i don't really know what to do now. we were best friends in high school but didn't get together until college and have been pretty much inseparable ever since. when we first got together we were very immature and toxic (he used to be selfish sometimes and i have bpd, so i would lash out a lot) and probably should have broken it off then, but we both decided to stick with it and grow into a more mature, healthy relationship together. and i think we actually managed to do that. sure, we occasionally fought but we always worked it out, kept open communication, and apologized while coming to a compromise. our lives are heavily intertwined and we supported one another in our goals, pushing each other to be better. the problems started up again a couple of weeks ago when he went on a work trip and came back. he sat me down and said that he wasn't happy with the way things were, as he felt like we were no longer our own people, more so we just became an extension of each other. it took me some time to see his point of view and i agreed, that maybe we needed space. sunday mornings were then set apart for him to do his own thing (he works full time and i work part time while going to school full time so we heavily spent the weekend together since we didn't have much time during the week). i guess this agreement wasn't really working because two days ago after he came home from hanging out with coworkers he was laying next to me and told me that even though he loves me, he wasn't sure he was in love with me anymore. we decided he would take the next day to figure out what he wanted to do and when we talked again he said it wasn't fair to either of us to continue in this type of relationship (he had apparently been feeling this way for about two months), since he didn't want to keep stringing me along and he broke up with me. before he did he suggested couple counseling but i wasn't sure if that would help since the problem seemed to be that he just wasn't feeling the same about me anymore. i would like to point out that we both have a history of mental illness, depression being the biggest, and i had assumed he was not only depressed, but under a lot of stress from work as he has a timeline over his head that will result in him either staying with the company or being fired. i am in my second to last semester in school and have been very stressed overall due to curriculum changes this semester. i asked him if there was someone else and he said no, which i believed as we are open about things like that and he doesn't seem like the type. we live together but own no property and have no kids. we decided to continue living together until the lease is up (september 2023), as by that time i will have graduated and hopefully found a full time job. we live in the us, in a pretty pricey part of the country so this is the best financial decision for both of us. i asked him not to rush the divorce in hope that this will pass but i'm not sure it will. i don't really know why i'm writing this post. i guess i'd just like some advice on how to move on with my life. thanks for reading, sorry it's so long.",advice,0,3412.0,662.0,7.5,0.013595166163141994,0.004531722054380665,0.09214501510574018,0.0,0.0

"i keep trying to give the father of my child (he says that we are partners) opportunities to be a good father and i am exhausted. our relationship has always been rocky. he is an alcoholic with some deep-seeded issues. we have been together for a little over a year, and in that time he has made some questionable decisions that leave me unable to trust him. i try. our last violent fight, he smashed the window of my car to choke me, and that is the fight that gave me the leverage i needed with a visual aid that said that he needed to get sober. he's done relatively well since, and i am proud of him. i am 31, so when i became pregnant i was ecstatic, i didn't think i could have kids with some previous procedures i've had done. so fast forward to now. my water broke 2 months early, i was on bed rest in the hospital for almost 2 weeks. my daughter was born 6 weeks premature and was in the icn for 3 weeks. it was hell. her father was never there. he never asked. he'd call me to fight or talk about how great things are going for him. he left me in the hospital twice after encouraging and instigating arguments that i am aware i shouldn't have participated in. i don't handle stress well, and it's all been stressful. he is paying for our apartment although he's never here, and recently gave me a safe car for my daughter. like i said, mine didn't have a window and i was his personal taxi for the last year and we ran my car into the ground. i appreciate what he's done for us although emotionally he is not available. i've tried to explain my stresses, while dealing with post partum. he says that i have borderline personality disorder and i have countless problems with myself, which might be true- but it's impossible to diagnose myself. we tried couples counseling but he says that our problems are ""too advanced"" and i need a psychologist, and insults whatever poor therapist gets stuck with us. every day it seems like i have a new problem. and lately i am just angry and sick from it. i don't understand how someone can not acknowledge or ask about their child. i've been taking care of her by myself, so i'm awake 24 hours a day. this week she has been constipated and had colic, it's been a hard week. it breaks my heart that he doesn't ask about her, especially while she's so fussy and uncomfortable. he says that we are partners, and tells me that he loves me and hopes to see me soon, but he doesn't ask how she's doing. he is volunteering with his other daughter's ski school, and spending a lot of time with her. he just got 50/50 custody of her recently and he's always asked about her and cared about seeing her. it really feels like when we decided to have a baby, he saw her as a back-up plan for if court failed. he did not visit my daughter in the icn. when he left last week, he left without making sure we had formula- which we didn't. he's unable to argue, and i can feel my anger and resentment towards him growing every day, and though my daughter is small, i try to keep from badmouthing him around her. every day i talk to him, i give him opportunities to be a good father. i don't care about our relationship so much anymore, because i don't know how to keep loving a person that acts like this, i am not talking to him for me. am i asking for too much by wanting him to just ask about her? today i'm upset because he called to tell me that he loved me and said that he's skiing and it made me pop off. he knows that she's not feeling well but it's like she doesn't exist to him. i am overtired and i worry for my daughter's future heartbreak. edit: i had a bad relationship with my father since childhood, so i'm feeling terribly guilty about burdening my daughter in the same ways that have damaged me. i'd hate for her to have an entirely absent father, and i'm not sure if it's worse to have a hurtful father or no father at all.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,7.0,0.00945945945945946,0.005405405405405406,0.10540540540540541,1.0,0.0

"seriously need advice, we are too similar hello guys came here for relationship advice, because i have no idea what i should do. i(25f) have been in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend (30m) for almost 10 months. five hour drive between our cities. he is my first boyfriend and only person i ever had sex with. i love him a lot. we have a lot of similarities. both of us only want serious relationships, we don't date people just for fun, have the same values in life and both want to have the same kind of life in the future. both are very honest, have a good intuition about people we meet, are cold at first and then if we like someone we just go fully bunny mode. funny enough even though we are different race people think we look alike. however we are both very emotional with mood swings, one day we can be confident and optimistic about the future but the next day extremely anxious and stressed ( in our defense we both are working on this particular personality trait). and most importantly neither of us knows what the hell we want to do in life in terms of a job. right now i'm doing my masters and he is looking for a job. since i met him he changed workplace 5 times, because of different reasons but mostly because he was trying to find a job he would like and he found one, but still he has days when he keeps asking me if this is the right job for him. i would say our communication is top notch, if there is a problem or an issue we discuss it and always try to understand each other. to be honest i understand him so well that usually he doesn't need to even tell me why he is upset or what's bothering him, because he is so similar to me that i just know. but i always ask him to tell me instead of assuming that i know everything about him. he is the person i always wanted to find, someone who would love me for who i am, love me even when i'm not in a good mood. i didn't date for so long because i never felt that guys liked me, not just the way i look, but he does. when i am with him i feel safe and i feel like i am home. however, i'm tired of being in a long distance relationship. my love language is touch and i have a much higher libido than him. sex is good but not great, i really want us to improve but we can't, as we see each other once or twice a month. i already told him that being in a long distance relationship is hard for me and he always tells me that we can do it and in 2 years after i graduate we will be together. but doing the job he wants would mean that he will have to move every 3-6 months especially during the first 5 years. he already told me when he will propose and when he thinks we should have children. but all i can think about is how much i don't want to be in ldr for 5 years. the biggest issue is that both of us are high in neuroticism. i already told him that i was worried that because both of us are quite anxious people, it might be a problem. we had a conversation and in the end told each other that we should work on ourselves, be more emotionally stable and more dependable. however, time has passed and i'm exhausted by dating someone who is as prone to anxiety and pessimistic thoughts as me. him assuring me that everything will work out, there is no need to worry about this and that and i should focus on the present that has no effect on me because in 2-3 days i will be the one giving the same speech. now that he is not working, he of course is worried and anxious, even though i am not in a good place either, i force myself to smile and just try to not talk to him for a long time because adding his negative emotions with mine might drive me nuts....i feel so bad about this, because i know exactly how he feels and i'm his girlfriend.... so is this how real relationships are? what's the solution?",advice,0,3794.0,687.0,3.0,0.004010695187165776,0.008021390374331552,0.10828877005347594,2.0,0.0
"not sure (27f) about transitioning from 3-year long-distance to living together at the other side of the world hi, i have been having this 3-year-old long-distance relationship with my (27f) bf (30m). we met through an international work event abroad, and we bounded almost immediately. we managed to stay together even with the distance. the covid time was pretty hard as we were not able to see each other at all for a couple of months but hopefully, this time is behind us. the long-distance factor makes us see each other regularly (roughly once a month) and for some short periods (from 4 to 15 days). we share the same educational background and general values. as my bf was used to living on his own, he made it clear that even when we were seeing each other he needed his personal space from time to time. i understood it, and we managed to find a good balance between us-time and self-time. my biggest concern is that i am not sure he is willing to build something with me. he is not super communicating by default, and it seems like he already has his solo routine that i am not sure i can fit into it. i also feel like i am way more invested in the relationship than him. i don't know what to do now. we are supposed to move together this summer to the other side of the world to work in the same company and finally live together, but i am having second doubts about it (even though it is a bit too late, considering i didn't apply for some extension at my current work and i have already accepted the offer at the new job).",advice,0,1536.0,293.0,0.0,0.0,0.0034129692832764505,0.09215017064846416,0.0,0.0
"my (35f) fiance of (38m) 3 years wants to "" evaluate his options again."" my fiance "" james"" and i have been together for 6 and a half years. i told him when we first started dating that i was at the point of my life ( late twenties) where i knew that i wanted kids, and that wasn't going to change. james told me he also wanted kids- it was just a matter of how many he wanted. he also said he wanted to find somebody to be "" young family"" with. now i have just turned 35 and james is about to turn 39. he proposed to me 3 years ago but he has basically walked back more and more of the steps he took post proposal regarding setting a wedding date. he has gone from actively suggesting wedding planners and asking his brother in law to be his best man to firing the wedding planner behind my back and making plans for all the time that he is free during the spring and summers to be with his friends, or to go to one industry conference or another. i have tried to get him to come with me to therapy but one day when he didn't show up the therapist said to me "" therapy can help you talk through some things, but it cannot convince somebody to do or believe something that they are inherently opposed to for whatever reason. james is allowing you to view the trajectory of your relationship through a version of reality more beneficial to him than you, but is ultimately false to him. he now sees you as someone trying to make him conform to your "" false"" sense of reality and is punishing you for it."" i was so upset after that session that i stopped going to therapy for a while, languishing in denial. i finally tried to bring it up and james actually flipped out and said he felt like he was the victim here. he said the therapist was partially right: i was trying to make his actions match up with my worldview and it annoyed him to pieces. he says bottom line he did not want to begin to think about marriage or kids with me for at least another year. he accused me of rushing things and stormed off. afterwards he confessed that he needed to explore his options at least theoretically speaking. he dropped the bombshell that he didn't think i would be the ideal mother to his kids. and he believes in marriage before kids and for the purpose of kids so that explained the hold off on marriage. the reason he cites for him not being sure about me is that he thinks our relationship initially went too fast. that we moved in together after a year and that his parents who are happily married continue to have an issue with that. however, the root of the problem is that when we started to get to know each other sexually speaking, he told me he wanted to explore more unconventional interests. one of it included him tying me up, putting his fist inside me, and also him urinating and defecating on me. he said his mind took a picture of those compromising situations and he cannot get over it. there was sometimes alcohol involved but we both agreed to do it and only with each other. however, he is now saying that it was horrible and that he doesn't trust my decisions, especially when alcohol and sleeping together are involved. that if he is looking at our kid or watching me give birth, that will be all he can think of. he said he was sorry but cannot reframe his perception of me into a mother and hates me for it. since we were airing everything, i told him i suspected he was cheating. he said he wasn't but admitted that his brother's wife had a younger sister who was a new graduate from college. he said people in his circle have been pressuring him, saying she was a nice, intelligent person who lived at home during college and didn't drink or do drugs. and that james could be brothers twice over with his brother. but he admitted that he found younger me way more attractive than her. after our talk i was devastated. he said he was going away for the week to think but after that week he asked if he could come back and tried to sleep with me again, getting upset when i refused. what do i do? some corners of my social circle are saying that he's just confused and to fight for my 6 year relationship since we were so close to the altar. i really want a kids and family but i often see resentment in james' eyes when he looks at me. he never called off the engagement, saying he considers it still on.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,0.0,0.0,-0.0012224938875305623,0.0647921760391198,1.0,0.0

"i [30f] was perfectly happy being single until i started to fall for a guy [30m] who left me heartbroken, and now all i can think about is how badly i want a relationship and feel so sad - how do i be okay again? when my last relationship ended two years ago, i was so drained and emotionally exhausted. i really needed to be on my own, and loved not having to worry about another person. i rebuilt my life, made new friends, worked on my career. i was really happy. i was going on dates, but fine being single even if it meant i never found someone. i also suspect i might have been shutting down some of my emotions and not letting myself feel vulnerable. i met some nice guys but no one i really connected with and hadn’t had much luck. anyways, i meet this guy recently. he checks all the boxes i want in a partner. i have so much fun with him. we get to know each other, have a shared sense of humor, lots in common. the sex is great. and after maybe our third date, i’m conscious of this wall i have put up to not feel my feelings. and i gradually start to lower it, and i feel that rush when you’re falling for someone and it’s just a flood of good feelings. i realize i really like this guy, and could see this going somewhere and want to be with him. and after another date or two, he ends things to date someone else who makes more logistical sense for him. i was devastated. to be fair i was just getting to know this guy. i’m sad things ended with him, but know it’s better to end now when it didn’t go too far than months or years down the line. however, it feels like the floodgates came open on my feelings, and now all i want is to find someone i love and to be in a relationship. i realize all the parts of that i miss, and i’m so ready to find my person, especially as all my friends around me are starting to marry and i’m one of the few single women left. i want to feel okay on my own again, but i realize i don’t want to be on my own anymore.and i’m so frustrated with how hard dating is, and hearing from my married friends how they are so glad they don’t have to do it anymore. i don’t know how to get back to where i was, or how to feel okay being single when it’s not what i want. and now i worry i may never find someone and it makes me upset, just based on how hard and long it took to find this guy i fell for, and he didn’t even choose me. i’m being as proactive as i can to find someone, but i’m so sick of it. so just any general advice welcome.",advice,0,2477.0,522.0,4.0,0.007662835249042145,0.005747126436781609,0.12260536398467432,1.0,0.0

(she has absolutely 0 hobbies other than tiktok). 2. always fighting over dumb things 3. we have said very bad things when fighting (like i hate you and wish i never got into this relationship etc.) 4. the relationship has declined since the second month 5. sudden trash moods that ruin my mood 6. i don’t feel like i want her to know me more / don’t want to open up to her anymore 7. i feel relieved when i get more time to myself than with her 8. always happy if she has to go somewhere that isn’t with me 9. always asking me if i love her or if i’m going to leave her and all of that about 20 times a day and always makes me swear my answers. (this happens everyday and has happened throughout the whole relationship since she has abandonment issues) 10. for the past six months, our conversations are mostly us trying to fix things because of a fight the previous day or we are fighting about some dumb thing again 11. has depression and bdp. these are probably killing our relationship since her psychologist “sucks” according to her. 12. there’s always something wrong in her life and she can never find the good side of things. she once told me she hated that i always looked for the good in a bad situation. i admit it could get annoying, but i’ve worked on that and she has never brought it up again. 13. this is a long distance relationship. when i came back home for christmas (she lives in this country where my parents live as well), we fought the first and third days of me being here. today is the fourth day. 14. i kind of don’t want to make new friends because she is very jealous of anyone and everyone who steals my attention from her. (she has also said this jokingly many times before, but it’s one of those things you know deep inside is not a joke). i know i won’t be able to hang out with them because she will think i’m cheating. if you made it to the end, when is it time to give up? tldr: girlfriend has some really good qualities that i’m afraid i won’t find somewhere else. she also has some really bad qualities i would be happy with them disappearing forever.",advice,0,2741.0,514.0,1.0,0.0019455252918287938,0.017509727626459144,0.08949416342412451,1.0,0.0

"how to find new things to do together and improve our marriage (34 m/f) my wife (34f) and i (34m) have been married about 8 years now. we have no kids and both work 9-5 m-f style jobs. apart from work, we don't really have a lot going on. the other day we were talking and she said that i don't like to spend time with her and just want to do my hobbies and spend time with my friends. these hobbies she refers to are things like playing board games with friends, do jigsaw puzzles, go bowling, listen to music, browse videos on my computer, and running/jogging. i told her that invite her whenever i do these and she almost always declines and said ""those are your hobbies and not what i enjoy."" now for board games, i was trying to have some friends come over to play board games with us about once a month, but end up only having this like 4-6 times per year. whenever we have this, i always ask her what game she wants to play and what friends she wants to invite to try to involve her more (she claims she likes playing board games when i ask and even will search out and purchase new games). she never invites anyone and i end up inviting 2 or 3 friends (1 of which is a mutual friend we shared in hs). when we start playing games, she often just wants to talk about random things and not pay really close attention, which causes me to be frustrated because of how infrequently we actually have people over for games. after an hour or 2, she gets bored and leaves the room so my friends and i continue. if i suggest any game other than the 1 or 2 specific games she happens to want to play, she won't even participate at all. when my friends leave, she complains that they stayed too long and she felt too embarrassed to spend the time how she wanted (watching korean dramas). we play games in the basement, and the tv isn't in the basement, but in a room directly up the stairs from the basement. my friends typically stay 4-5 hours. we usually all eat lunch together first (my wife included) before playing games and when they leave my wife always says how starving she is and how they stayed so long and just wanted them to leave so we could eat dinner. usually after 3.5-4 hours of games, she will constantly text me saying how hungry she is and asking when we are going to be done. several weeks or months after playing, i'll bring up having games again and she never seems interested and i feel like i can't invite my friends over because it seems to somehow ""ruin"" her time or make her jealous that i ""just want to hang out with my friends and not her."" so i asked her what her hobbies were (already knowing the answer) and how she wants to spend time together. she said that she just likes to read books and watch korean dramas. i told her that i read a lot of the same books (and attend the monthly book club she hosts at our house) and we discuss the books. i've occasionally watched some of those dramas, but they aren't my thing. these aren't really ideal things for us to do together in the meaningful way she seems to envision wanting. we started watching some other types tv shows (things we find on netflix and agree to watch) together so i asked her about that and she said that those shows she watches just so we can spend time together and isn't what she really wants to watch. i feel like we spend a lot of time just sitting around in each others' presence where we are both on our phones or we talk, which seems to often consist of her airing her grievances. i'm often frustrated and bored after a while of this. she doesn't seem to want to do much of anything i suggest. i also feel like 80% of her conversation is complaints and i feels she complains about something almost every single day: work, people at work, her family, my family, some random thing from the past, something someone said, etc. i feel like i'm pretty patient and listen to all of this, but i'm just getting fed up with all the negativity. i've eventually told her this, but it doesn't really change the overwhelming level of complaints she seems to have. the one thing we both enjoy is traveling for vacations, but this only happens a handful of times per year. i also am feeling less motivated to plan these as well as nearly every vacation, there's 1 day where she seems pouty and will say things like ""my day is ruined and i just want to go home"" and act like everything we do is miserable for her for a bit. she eventually recovers from this mood and thoroughly enjoys the vacation and will say how great it is and be enthusiastic for most of it. things didn't used to be this bad and she used to seem to enjoy things i did more, but i don't even know what she wants us to do together. does anyone have any ideas on fulfilling ways to spend time together? is there maybe something deeper going on that i need to try to address? it seems we are both very unfulfilled, but i don't know how to improve this.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,4.0,0.004319654427645789,0.0,0.07775377969762419,2.0,0.0
"my (22m) ex girlfriend (23f) has another relationship while telling me she still loves me and it makes me upset tldr; my ex gf has another relationship while telling me she still loves me and it makes me upset. my ex girlfriend and i met online three years ago and have been in a long distance relationship for two years, seeing each other in person only for a few weeks in total. she broke up with me almost one year ago because i told her i wouldn’t be able to move to her country and so, if we wanted the relationship to work, she would have to move here (big mistake, i know). despite the breakup, we kept talking from time to time. the conversations were mostly about us giving updates on each others’ lives and me telling her that i had realised my big mistake and would be ready to start again. she would always reply that, although she still loved me, she was not in the mood for a long distance relationship. things remained stationary for a couple of months until she tells me that she went to bed with her best friend. i ask her why she’s telling me this, and she replies that she thinks it’s right for me to know and that it’s not a big deal because we are not together anymore. i thought she was right. after some time i notice she starts publishing pictures of them together so i ask her if they are officially together now, at which she says that he’s only a friend with benefits and that she has told him multiple times that i am the one she loves, so i shouldn’t worry about him. i lose my temper at this, telling her it’s not fair that she shows up every once in a while telling me she still loves me but that she is going to bed with another man. i tell her i think she’s just playing with me, so we have an argument and decide to stop talking altogether. fast forward a couple of months, she texts me saying that she has only recently realised that her friendship with benefits was starting to become a real romantic relationship, so she decided to dump him because deep down she still felt like she loved me. i was happy to hear this because i too still had feelings for her and so we started texting on a regular basis again. at one point she even invites me to go on a trip with her next january, which i accept. one day while we were texting she confesses to me that she had continued to go to bed with his (now ex) friend with benefits during this whole time, but that her heart was only thinking about me so i shouldn’t be worried. i again lose my temper, telling her that she could have any relationship she wanted, but she shouldn’t come back to me every time saying that she still loves me, knowing full well how much i still care about her. i had also started getting paranoid any time she told me she was going out with someone else, thinking it was him. so i tried to convince myself that the best thing to do was to just stop talking with her and start over. i decided that we had to talk about this in person, thinking it would help me close this chapter and get over her once and for all. so i reached her in real life and we spent some days together (like normal friends). in retrospect, this turned out to be not so good of an idea since it only made me feel worse. luckily enough, my friends helped me get through this bad period and i thought i was out of it for good. we had not talked for weeks after the trip, when all of a sudden she texts me asking me how my life was going. we start talking again and, being the dumbass that i am, i start thinking that maybe she has finally decided to get back together so i ask her if it’s okay for her to give us a second chance. and she says she is seriously considering this idea, but she still has to think. maybe the vacation we have planned for january will help her decide, she adds. needless to say, i feel over the moon, but at the same time i start getting paranoid again. i start overthinking every time she says she is going out with friends or that she will spend the night at someone else’s place. yesterday the same scenario happens and i snap, saying that i’m having trouble trusting her and that i would like more reassurance on her part whenever she tells me she is going to see her friends. she rightly says that we are not together, and that, again, she has the right to do everything she wants as long as she is single. this morning i decide to call her, apologising for my controlling and paranoid behaviour, and for ruining her night out, finally agreeing with what she had said last night. she reassures me saying that it’s normal to overthink and that i shouldn’t worry about anything. but i still had that hunch from yesterday, so i ask her where she is. she replies she is at her ex’s house and that she has slept with him last night. i have a massive breakdown and start crying. at the same time she says that maybe she was wrong and maybe we are not ready to get back together because we keep hurting each other. she suggests we stop talking for good and perhaps try and find a new love. she also says that she doesn’t like the fact that every time she shows some interest towards me, i immediately expect her to act as i we were together (aka i expect her not to go to bed with anyone). lastly, she again says that she can do whatever she wants as long as she is single and that i shouldn’t feel upset because her and i are just friends. we agreed to give us a couple of days to think about this. now i feel awful thinking that i have ruined my last chance with her.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,7.0,0.0064754856614246065,0.004625346901017576,0.09990749306197964,0.0,0.0

"boyfriend upset i got jealous my boyfriend (27) and i (25) have been together over a year and are both university students. in his program he has a tight knit of people that he studied with that include mostly him and two other girls. his classes are very difficult, so i understand the need to create community with like minded people in order to make it through. i have never protested, or brought up any sort of jealousy or comment even when he’d be going over to their houses without telling me to study. he has also reassured me that the two girls have boyfriends so again, i do not have a problem and i trust my boyfriend. last week he brought up a ‘end of the year’ snowboarding trip him and the other people in his class were going to go on and that i was invited. he said the original plan was that him and one of the girls were going to drive down alone together, but i was invited. this idea of them making a plan to drive down alone together and then invite me as an after thought made me a little uneasy but i didn’t say anything. today, i recently got sick and hurt my back so i wont be able to go. he brought it up again today that they were leaving tomorrow morning and that him and this girl were driving down together. so i decided to bring up my discomfort and ask if it was weird that they had made these plans to drive down together without asking me if i would be okay with it first, and then asked if the situation was reversed how he would feel. his response was to get very frustrated with me and say if i had a problem i should have brought it up earlier and that he was just not going to go and then stormed out of the house… i feel really bad because i do trust him and this girl and i really shouldn’t have made that comment i just through it would be a basic respect thing when you’re in a relationship.. i doubt he will want to talk to me today since he’s studying (at their house again) and i don’t want to be represented as a crazy jealous girlfriend either. what do i do?",advice,0,2005.0,399.0,1.0,0.002506265664160401,0.0,0.08270676691729323,1.0,0.0

"my boyfriend's friends don't like me and it is causing issues me (18f) and my boyfriend of 1 month go to the same class and we are in the eu so all of the classes we have we have with the same people. he hangs out with a group of people (both boys and girls, about 10 of them) in my class that i don't hang out with, but i don't really have anything against them. recently, he was invited to go watch a fifa football match with them and he invited me to go with them. i accepted. however, he told me he needs to ask his friends if that would be okay with them. he told me he would ask in the groupchat but he ended up asking the organiser and the boy told him something like ""well i don't really have a good relationship with op (me) but you have to ask the others"" this confused me because i never really talked to that boy so it's not like we are on bad terms or anything. it was just weird. i guess this scared my boyfriend off and instead of asking the others we just watched the match at his place, but i felt a little guilty that he didn't get to spend it with his friends because it seems that they don't want me there. the thing is, i have no clue why they don't want me to hang out with them and he doesn't know either. they also took a few pictures of us together during the class and we don't know why they do this but with that and what happened with the football match my boyfriend told me he suspects they don't like me for some reason. he plans to confront them about it though. he was also invited to a new years eve party with the same group and he wants me to be there too but suspects he will not really get positive feedback if he asks if i can come. he has yet to ask though. this is all making me feel really bad and unwanted. i find it stupid that this group of people who i never wronged just seem so off put by the idea of me hanging out with them. i guess i am also bothered by the fact that my boyfriend is putting off even asking them at all or confronting them. i know he wanted to watch the football match with them too and i know he wants to spend new years eve with them as well as with me. it makes me feel as if he has to choose between me or them constantly and that because of this he spends less time with his friends. i feel guilty because of this but i also feel like he is ashamed of me because they don't seem to like me for whatever reason. i get that he doesn't want to make his friends uncomfortable if they don't want me there but i don't know how to feel about this. i don't know what to do about this anymore and if this persists i feel like it will just become a bigger problem. i also feel like it is such a ridiculous situation. please i need some advice. tldr: my boyfriend's friend group doesn't seem too keen on the idea of me hanging out with them and i feel bad about it.",advice,0,2826.0,574.0,1.0,0.0017421602787456446,0.0017421602787456446,0.10278745644599303,0.0,0.0
"long distance pregnant ex gf and her relationship with another man.. i met this girl on facebook a year ago. we were long distance friends for a bit, texting constantly throughout the day, short phone calls couple times a week, occasionally a super long call lasting 2-3 hours long into the morning. she's been to see me a few times, but it's been mainly me going to see her, 7 hours away. it's more challenging for her to come see me. she has 2 dogs, that she brings with her (which is fine with me because i love dogs and have one of my own), and her car isn't reliable, it's getting older and breaking down a bit. so i've been understanding about not coming to see me as much. she was raped by her older brother when she was a little girl. she never went to therapy for it and says she'll take it to her grave, her brother is still part of her life and they're close. and she has had toxic romantic relationships throughout her life, her previous boyfriends were abusive, verbally and physically and also cheaters. her and i didn't meet for 3-4 months, it was all talking in the beginning and building a friendship but we did have a sexual component and it's been pretty wild. there's been some red flags since the beginning that i ignored. her liking older guys isn't the issue for me. it's that she has a 68 year old male friend (retired dr, and my gf is a nurse- they used to work together, he was friendly with all the nurses, but they developed a special bond, and they've been friends for like 3 years). before my gf and i began talking, her and this guy got covid together and they decided to quarantine together so they could take care of each other. she told me she slept in his bed (clothed, she says). what was i going to say? it is weird and inappropriate to me, def not normal, but we weren't together. also this guys ex wife tried to run my gf over with her car, again before her and i were together. my gf says the ex wife is insecure and jealous and psycho. to me this is not right. the ex wife may have mental issues but i'm sure she was feeling what i'm feeling, that the relationship between my gf and this guy is too close. over the course of our relationship tho, once we were boyfriend and girlfriend, my gf and him would do things that were inappropriate. just the sheer amount of time they spend together bothers me. one time this guy had a panic attack and drove himself to the er at 5am and texted my gf. fine, whatever. well my gf literally lost her mind over it, waking me up at 5am telling me i need to pray for this guy and she is so upset over it. like holy shit, calm down. he had a panic attack. he's a grown man. as soon as she got out of work, drove soup and sandwiches over to his house, spent 2-3 hours there, then they went back to her place to walk her dogs and then went for a long drive at night to go get slushies and hang out til like 10 or 11 at night. it caused a fight with us. i said it's too much. this is stuff boyfriend and girlfriend do. it's one thing to bring food over and hang out for a bit, but that's overboard. my gf just says i'm insecure and jealous and it actually makes me question myself if i am being that way or if this is really not normal and completely inappropriate. it's not just any guy. he has confessed to being in love w her and wishing he could give her marriage and kids, has made comments about her tits (she told me this), discouraged her from being with my because i'm a teacher and can't provide for her, has said some super abusive and toxic things to my gf in the early stages of our relationship which used to really upset her and it would be this huge thing which always ended in her getting distant with me. ice always felt live i've had to fight to be her bf. this guy mows cuts her lawn, does her oil change, fixes things in her house, he stops over with food at 10:30 at night if she's having a hard time, she goes to his house for dinner then back over the next morning for breakfast, they do activities together on the weekend.. she says he's like a father figure to her. my gf's family adores him, he brings her dad gifts, visits her dad with and without her, is her plus 1 to weddings and family events, her sister and husband invited the two of them out to dinner like a double date, she went to his house and they drove to a giant bonfire together recently.. it's not the fact that he's a male that bothers me, although i am a guy and know what guys think and i wasn't wrong about this.. so one night after a wedding they attended, he told her he was in love with her and if only he was younger he would marry her and want to give her kids. my gf laughed this off. she would never set any kind of boundaries with this guy. you would think after that she would take a step back and not continue to spend so much time with him because that sends the wrong message. and to be honest i feel that it's not considerate of my feelings them acting like this. she doesn't know what clear boundaries mean besides not being in his life. napping in his bed and acting like bf/gf/married, vs not being in his life. there's a huge gap there. and she says i'm insecure and don't understand how close their friendship is, she says it's unconventional and no one gets their bond. but this guy used to verbally abuse her and say messed up things to her and it would really effect her and she would then want space from me! i said no that's not ok and put a stop to that right away. i told her i didn't want to hear about his outbursts because it causes her to want space from me and ends up in a fight for us because i hate how he would speak to her and how he treated her and thought it was f'ed up. one day my gf said to me that one of her friends had an infection and she wanted to catheterize them and asked me how i felt and i right away asked her if it was this guy and she said yes. i said absolutely not. he can go get it done professionally at the doctors. or do it himself. i don't want her holding his dick, staring her right in the face, etc etc. it pissed me off and hurt me that she even thought this was ok to ask me about given the situation. she has admitted to me before wanting to cancel our facetime date because she wanted to stay at his house. she would assure me that she has no physical or romantic feelings for him and if she wanted to be with him, she wouldn't waste her time dating me who's 7 hours away and assured me she loved me. but to me, someone who loves somebody and is happy, doesn't pull this shit. she would always bring his name up- in bed, in the car, over the phone, out to dinner, his name is always in my face. she says he is a father figure to her, but i never met the guy. she asked him once if he would meet me and he said it wasn't essential. on the other hand all of my friends have been dying to meet her because they saw how happy she makes me and they want to be introduced to her. that's normal. all of our fights have been about this guy. recently i'd say about a month or so ago, she took a nap in his bed. now she lives 10 min away. i got upset when she told me this and she got upset and said she would do it anyway and not tell me, she can never do anything right, everything w this guy is always an issue, etc. telling me i'm insecure. she is also pregnant by the way. 3 months along. everyone asks me am i sure it's my child and i say yes. i believe her that this isn't his baby. this guy has set my gf up with another man before we began dating, a few years before actually. so i don't think the old guy and my gf are physical but i just think it's a very strange relationship that may have to do with her sexual trauma and maybe she feels a pull to him. she's extremely defensive about their friendship and has made it clear to me several times she will never kick him out. to be honest, when she tells me she doesn't know what ""clear boundaries"" are, i honestly don't know how she doesn't. my brain automatically thinks in my interactions w female coworkers and friends throughout the day to act respectful as if my gf was standing right there and take into consideration my gf's feelings, basically not flirt or entertain anybody or put myself in compromising positions. it's a no brainer for me. this guy bought her a $200 necklace and my gf just says ""it's an emf protection necklace!"" like i actually care what kind it is, it's still a $200 piece of jewelry that she wears constantly. she told me she stopped staying at his house late til 1am or 2am. that she doesn't see him anymore. and i simply say, ""yeah, as of what, 7 days ago??"" it's just us going in circles. since she got pregnant, she has been extremely depressed and resentful of me that i'm not just going to uproot and move there in the middle of all this chaos. i have full time job w benefits, a small business, and another part time job and i don't want to take a big pay cut to move there and also don't want to leave my family. i've told her this from day 1. she's told me from day 1 that she wants to move to my state, called me her future husband.. one time i was visiting her and at her sisters baby shower and i walked by her and her younger sis talking and the younger sis says to her ""i thought you were dating *\_\_\_*."" i turned and saw my gf's face was beet red. it was not fun hearing that. but of course according to my gf, her younger sis is only 13 and you can't go by what she says. in my opinion, their relationship is weird, inappropriate and too close and my gf isn't treating me with respect and since finding out she was pregnant she has treated me so poorly, stopped putting any and all effort into our relationship. when i visited a month ago, she practically ignored me. the little things she used to do, the little displays of physical affection, the loving text messages, sharing of our day w photos and videos, just everything has sucked. i haven't made her feel like she has to move here but as her bf i told her, i found a place for us to live here that's spacious and nice and i would take care of the rent and support her and the baby and i'd help her move, help her with things through the pregnancy, basically i've been trying to be the most loving supportive bf i can possibly be in this situation besides move. would i consider it if things were different and we weren't having issues like this? hell yes i would consider it. at least temporarily so she can go through the pregnancy and the baby's first year or two there with her family. but i know moving there w the current state of things would be a mistake and i'd end up leaving within 6 months because we'd be miserable. baby aside, our relationship absolutely sucks now. my gf basically provoked me a ton throughout our short relationship by entertaining inappropriate things with this guy and doing things that are inappropriate. and he has been doing the same. he discouraged her from being with me early on because i'm a teacher and am not worth millions like him. my gf just laughs this stuff off, says it's out of her control, and allowed him to shit all over our relationship and i honestly think she likes the attention from him. which is confusing because i give her so much attention. our sex life like i said earlier is wild, we are such a perfect match there, she also believes that. but she has told me before he's there, and i'm 7 hours away. he's also basically the only person she hangs out with. they're basically married. and do everything but fuck and make out. but he would love to. it all came crashing down a week ago when i realized i have not been able to get over the things that have happened and how my gf would initially react when i bring up how uncomfortable it makes me (she'd blow up at me, say i'm insecure, jealous, don't understand their friendship, tell me she'll do things anyway and just not tell me, such as nap in his bed).. i realized i haven't been able to get over it, that i don't completely trust her, because at some point he crosses a boundary or she does, and i just sit around waiting for it to happen,and just hearing his name triggers me at this point. this is not an isolated incident either. there's been another friend who lurks around and disrespects me/our relationship because he wants to fuck her as well. her and i would be in bed and he'll start blowing up her phone w calls and texts at 6am. says things like he needs his fix. my gf will ignore for a few days then throw him a breadcrumb basically then it starts all over again, my gf complains to me how she is just not available and doesn't like when he does that, and in my head i'm thinking to myself, yes she does like the attention and if she really wanted to set a boundary she would, and it can be done in a way that isn't rude. anyway i broke up with her a week ago after all of this, and most recently the last few months when she's visited me or i've visited her, she turns down every suggestion i have to do something together and wanted to just be depressed, sleep or text with that guy. so i told her look, we can be friendly, cordial, and i will do my best to coparent from afar, but i told her i don't want to tolerate this kind of behavior from a gf. i deserve better. there's no healthy communication, loyalty, respect, trust, effort, on her part. me i have been fighting for this relationship for a while, voicing my concerns, coming up with solutions on how to make it work, and she's just done because she says i'm insecure and somethings always an issue with this guy. i'm extremely upset, i didn't want to break up, as terrible as it sounds, i love her and want to raise the baby together, and make this work, but her actions show me something completely different. i worry that we won't be able to reconcile in the future. i feel like i would need this guy to be gone from her life and i just don't see that happening ever. she said she wants god to remove these issues from her, wants god to tell her what boundaries are appropriate and if/when god wants this guy out of her life. i love god but i think that's bullshit. she doesn't went help. says she does but really doesn't. i have explained over and over how this guy and situation makes me feel and it's like she doesn't get what a healthy platonic friendship w a male looks like and how to set boundaries when one person crosses the line repeatedly, she's crossed the line too. she can't possibly be this dumb and think it's all ok. she says she isn't romantic w him or physically attracted to him but im just not comfortable with all that's happened and i don't think i can be ok going to her baby shower with him there and him basically being more involved in my child's life than me. recently she went to him upset that she won't be able to pay her rent and he offered to pay her entire rent every month. also bought her a pregnancy pillow which was something i was going to do the day that i found that out. i felt like he overstepped again and if he doesn't overstep then she does and i'm always on edge wondering what's going to happen next with them. even her just going to his house 10 min away, getting in his truck and driving to a big bonfire together makes me upset because they act like bf/gf, or her sister and her husband inviting the two of them out to dinner like a double date..",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.00439634764964491,0.003043625295908015,0.0693270206290159,4.0,0.0
"my boyfriend is unhappy with how our relationship is right now, how can i make it better? tl/dr : boyfriend doesn't feel like i put enough effort in the relationship but i don't know how to make it better/function like a normal girlfriend apologies as this is a bit long, i'm upset and struggling to make my thoughts make sense me (25f) and my bf(27m) have been together for just over 4 years, moved in together last year. he is in the armed forces and over the last year he has been gone for over half the year due to training/deployment. i have moved across the country to be with him when he was stationed at the base we are living at currently, and i have struggled to make any real friendships in the area due to working from home for most of the year, and i feel that this amongst other things such as him being gone for so long and issues with my mental health (medicated, not too relevant) i've become a bit of a recluse, not used to social contact, don't actively seek it out. i have since started a new job where i interact with actual people. due to him being away for so long i've gotten used to a bit of a routine and i spend a lot of time alone. i started a new job also and the hours are taking me a while to get used to so i am tired a lot of the time/want to take a nap after work, as i really struggle getting sleep with him in the bed with me, again as he's been gone for long. he has just told me he feels like we're two completely separate people that just happen to share a house, he's not happy with the lack of communication and affection, and not happy that i don't suggest to do anything together, and he doesnt like that it falls on him to instigate activities/conversation, which is all fair/reasonable because in reality we don't really do anything together. what brought this on was me not wanting to move my pc desk from the dining room where its been since march to upstairs (because i really couldn't be bothered, and also i vape so it's more convenient to be downstairs, i didn't personally see it as a big deal but i was wrong). after he voiced his opinion i told him we can do the move and spend time upstairs but he said we'll do it another time. i have apologised for making him feel sad/bad/neglected but things are awkward. my problem is i have genuinely not noticed this to be an issue as i'm used to being alone for so long, and since he's been back he's mostly seemed to be in a bad mood a lot and wouldn't tell me what's wrong so i figured i'd leave him to it until he was ready, as he normally struggles to have conversations about thoughts and feelings. this hasn't seemed to be an issue this week. at this point i don't even know how to start a normal conversation. i feel like all my social skills have erased themselves. i feel like i put a mask on when i go to work but as soon as i finish i could easily not even utter a single word the whole day. i just sort of exist i guess? i don't even know. anyway, i moved across country, changed jobs, tried my best to sort out my mental health (with his support) and i'm desperately trying to get myself a better future by starting uni next year. i've done the above to support him in his career and to make sure i don't become a burden in the future (my previous job was a dead end call centre and i wouldn't be able to do that and still somehow match his earnings in the future, i don't want to put us in a position where he's the primary breadwinner as the thought gives me anxiety and i don't want to be lesser than if that makes sense? like i want us to be equals. we've had a heart to heart a couple months ago where he said what he wants from a partner is someone who does what they can to better themselves, has aspirations, goals, and not smoking etc. i'm trying to meet those expectations because i really love him and i want to spend my life with him, and ive struggled with the above due to depression and just sort of giving up in the past. i am planning on quitting smoking but currently it is a crutch for me, after a conversation with my doctor she believes i'm quitting only for him and not for myself and until i'm fully ready in myself it'll be really hard. but from the conversation we've had today i'm scared he doesn't want the relationship to continue, he obviously didn't say that but i feel like i'm not putting enough effort into the relationship but i just don't know/understand how to do it, i somehow can't start a conversation with him, i can't bring myself to ask him to hang out or do couple things cause in my head, he's just doing his own thing, like playing games with his friends and stuff and i don't want to bother him, but that's not good enough. i don't know what's good enough anymore. it's like i've forgotten how to be in a relationship. our relationship has been really good this whole time really, we never really argue, we'll have an occasional disagreement but it doesn't usually take long to get resolved. i'm just so scared at the moment. i moved away from all my friends and family to live with him and i have no support network where we are now. i'm scared that he's going to end things, i'm scared ill have to move back with my mother (long story, difficult relationship), and i'll lose this new job which is a really good opportunity as i'm being trained in management, this is the first job that will open doors for me in the future, and due to various trips (family weddings in different countries, both my family and his), needing to buy a new car, bills etc, i have basically no savings to fall back upon if this relationship fails and i have to restart life elsewhere. but i don't even wanna think about that. i want this relationship to work. i want us to work it out. but also i don't know how to even function with another person anymore. how do i have a normal natural conversation with him? obviously i know that this can be solved with an adult conversation, you know like the adults we are, but i don't know how to go about it/express my feelings without potentially guilting him if i express the paragraph above, as i'm scared if i say all that he'll just not bring up how he feels again, and that's not healthy either. i just don't feel like i'm good enough for him i just don't know what to do, what can i do to make myself better at being a girlfriend?",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,4.0,0.0032679738562091504,0.011437908496732025,0.08088235294117647,5.0,0.0

[aunt] once disinvited her + the rest of family for being too overwhelmed to host a christmas party. won't go. i could come sylvester? -no. they already invited [mothers friend]. couch will be full. can't see that christmas becomes hell if we try to host it? she will end up crying, my father goes out for a ""walk"" (hours) and i will just hate my life, all over again? -i'd be a guest. that'd be different. it's just hell if i had done what i was told and pick up the pace. i know i'm an idiot for messing with crazy for sweet, sweet benefits. is this karma? should i just tough it out i'm throwing money together for a new laptop. it's a bit tough as i need to pay driving lessons off as well. plus college and stuff. sadly, my stay has already been organized (plus i'd rather unalive myself with a rusty spoon than spending another christmas like this), but now i need some strategy to keep her from going ballistic. at least till my midterm is over. tips??",advice,0,2594.0,481.0,3.0,0.006237006237006237,0.002079002079002079,0.0893970893970894,5.0,0.0

"my husband has completely changed and i don’t know what to do me (28f) and my husband (33m) have been dealing with some issues. i’m 9 months pregnant and his attitude towards me has changed very drastically. he’s stopped complimenting me and has become very irritable. we don’t get into arguments often, as i try to avoid upsetting him. he’s never hit me, but usually ends up breaking something or punching a hole in the wall. setting him off is really easy so i’m practically walking on eggshells. pregnancy has made me quite depressed, but i make sure he doesn’t see me upset/crying. i usually save my crying spells for the ride to/from work when i’m alone. he absolutely hates seeing my face anything but happy. despite telling him that my depression is caused by my hormones/stress (i just graduated and i’ve been studying for board/licensure exams), he takes this very personally and always tells me he’s going to “get tired” of me eventually and leave. these past few months he’s been refusing to let me pay any bills, which i feel is fueling his anger towards me. i tried sending him the money and he sends it right back. i work a regular 9-5 and have been really exhausted. i try my best to do household chores and to make sure everything is clean and he has food to eat. i hate that he’s not letting me pay for anything because i feel like this is constantly being held over my head. whenever he’s upset, he reminds me that i don’t pay for shit and that i have no right to be tired. whenever i have issues i want to discuss quietly, he begins to yell over me and remind me that his childhood was difficult and that he’s had to deal with a lot before me, basically avoiding the current problem. he immediately blows up and it almost always reduces me to tears. the pregnancy has made me quite insecure, which i understand is my problem to deal with. noticing his changing behavior stings a lot, especially when he tells me i look “ugly” whenever i put on makeup and dress up. the constant insults have reduced my confidence to shit, but he tells me he hates that i’m insecure. i really try my best to look good, but i’m always met with negative feedback. the outbursts have made me just keep problems to myself. we didn’t discuss anything for two weeks and everything was fine. i’ve told him in the past that i find it rude when he blatantly stares at other women in front of me to the point that they notice. i don’t mind him looking, but he keeps staring and it honestly makes me feel like shit. i just get in my head about all the times he insults my appearance and it hurts. i never said anything, but he noticed i caught him yesterday. i stayed quiet for a moment and he kept insisting that i tell him why i’m not smiling. i wasn’t angry, i was just afraid because i knew he would blow up when we got home. when i told him that i didn’t appreciate that he kept insisting i tell him, he got very angry. i told him i can’t work on my insecurities/fix the problems if i have to speak them into existence and then face his anger each time. it feels like i lose no matter what. he told me i need to do a better job at faking being happy around him. i don’t know what to do at this point. i’m hoping to get on antidepressants as soon as the baby is born. i’ve tried scheduling virtual therapy appointments, but he works from home and i’m scared that he’ll hear me talking to the therapist from the other room. every time i told him i have an appointment to speak to someone, coincidentally, his clients for that time block cancelled. it feels like i’m up against a wall.",advice,0,3577.0,687.0,3.0,0.00424929178470255,-0.00141643059490085,0.13172804532577903,0.0,0.0

"how should i deal with my sister's unhinged boyfriend? looking for some advice on my sister’s boyfriend. for context: me (37m) and my family are hispanic and progressive democrats but my sister (45f no kids) slid into the right wing pipeline maybe a decade ago. anyways sometime after the election of donald trump her boyfriend and i were drinking late at night and the subject of politics comes up. i tried being respectful and there were certain things we just have to agree to disagree on, at some point he just snapped and started calling everybody in our family terrible names and accusations. i mean calling my brother a pedophile and things like all democrats are pedophiles, conspiracy theories, and other unhinged rants. after i had enough of this i told him to go to bed and went for the door, and instead he stopped me, throwing his chest between the door and being very intimidating. he kept ranting about politics and other accusations against my family, pointing his finger at my chest, and trying to get me to push him off or something and threatened to fight me many times. at one point he snapped and began throwing a punch, and i just ducked and covered my head, but he stopped at the last minute and just screamed instead. to be fair, i did poke fun at his politics a lot and i did call him a loser several times, that i didn’t want to fight a family member late at night and this was just a loser activity, and multiple times trying to tell him to just let me go to bed. at another point he even told me i shouldn’t be dating white women (my wife is white) and that only white men should be dating white women. i laughed because he’s white dating an hispanic woman and he just said that’s different and that hispanic men are violent. finally after maybe 20 minutes of the most unhinged conversation i’ve heard in my life (way too much to list it all here) i was finally able to get inside the door and went to bed. i didn’t speak anything of it and have been mostly trying to keep the distance between him/them. now it’s after covid and our family is starting to get together a lot again, he apparently has left her to live with his family in another state, but they are still “together” and talk everyday. but my sister is visiting family a lot and she wants to get everyone together. but i really don’t want to see this guy again and i don’t feel safe are around him, especially when people are drinking. the thing is, she and everybody is acting like this is just some “drunken political argument” and that both sides were wrong because i was calling him a loser and stuff. well my family has discussed this at length and they don’t really like the guy either, they just say it’s who my sister has chosen and we have to respect her choice. but i really feel like this guy has it out for me especially because i’m dating a white woman, and that he would be likely to inflict violence against me again. i tried to tell this to my sister but she started crying and just made it out like i’m attacking her calling her boyfriend a loser, and that i just don’t like him because of his politics and race. i feel like she thinks she won’t find anybody else, so i was just trying to encourage her to start dating and to find somebody else, and that he was likely doing the same since they are not living together. she really didn’t want to hear that at all and it wasn’t received well. nobody is really understanding i literally just really don’t feel safe in his presence and that he would likely get violent towards me again. i really don’t want physical injury/death nor do i want some domestic violence charge or something because “both sides are at fault”. i was thinking of just saying, well maybe we can get together but nobody in the family should be allowed to drink? but even then, i feel like i’m doing a huge disservice to myself.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,2.0,0.0027063599458728013,0.0027063599458728013,0.07983761840324763,2.0,0.0

(i've never caused anyone a panic attack and i still feel deeply guilty about this incident.) but then we communicated, and i disclosed to him about my bpd. he was tip-toeing about if he only wants to be my colleague or if we can also be friends. there was not a clear line between what he wanted. but then again, we started to get closer, and it seems like he really did a lot of research about what is bpd. he asked me questions like 'if i say this, how did it feel in your brain?' i really appreciated how much effort he was giving, to know my condition better. people just avoid talking to me when they knew i have bpd, but he was different. i was being unreasonable to k for quite a lot of small events, but every time we'd talk and get over it. also, k was really interested in my relationship with an ex-housemate whom i visited on a trip recently. these confused me a lot because i thought k was attracted to me. and because i thought he liked me, i started to like him too, which i was never attracted to him until recently. k tried to cut me off completely last week because 1. i asked him to sit next to me at a football pub night event with other colleagues, because i wasn't feeling well in that environment, and i felt left out in the group conversation, especially when a was getting a lot of attention and k just talked to her a lot 2. i accused him of flirting with another young colleague (10 years younger than me) but not me, based on my own insecurity of being an over-30-year-old woman... i knew i screwed up and i was trying to apologize to him and showed him i know he has made effort on making me feel better. i knew he got frustrated when every time i just got triggered no matter how hard he tried to communicate. but then he said he doesn't want a romantic nor platonic relationship with me, he doesn't want to be friends outside of work. he made it clear that he has no feelings for me, and he can't take my emotional burden anymore. i got very very hurt of course, to an extent that i needed to contact my therapist and called some hotlines for help. i felt like i failed the whole country and if this lovely group of people don't like me, where else can i go? do i even have a future? does my effort just so easily taken by someone who just naturally has it? - i understand the 'romantic feelings' might just be one-sided, which is painful but still fine. the 'no friendship outside work' part was what really got me. i felt like i was denied of everything i did to him nicely in the past, that i don't even deserve to be a friend - the most basic thing you can have with another human being. not to mention he kept saying how lovely a is, and 'i feel closer to a as a friend'... this was like a knife cutting my neck. there were 3 days we worked together but i ignored him on purpose even though he tried to ask how are you, because it was just too difficult for me. s was kind of being our 'middleman' to talk about what happened with both of us separately. until s said 'the friendship doesn't work' - i got a big trigger and just won't stop crying during work hours, so i asked to talk to k face to face, and he said yes. it was last night, and we both apologized to each other, he explained he was just running out of options on how to communicate with me about setting his boundaries, and he knew the wording he used was hurtful. everything was fine until we talked about a. k has said before that a is more compatible with him, she is more natural, and easy to talk to, and they share the same humor. i explained that i did try to talk to a (even though k said i distanced her on purpose, which make me feel unfair), i tried to have lunch with her and talk to her, but personally, i don't find myself really vibing with her, i don't find the dynamic interesting either - k immediately said 'she is interesting', and when i mentioned i think i'm caring, k immediately said 'she's caring too', he said he understands i've always been very generous (buying the group customized souvenirs for each of them), 'but caring comes in different ways' - it feels like he could only see my gestures as me wanting people's approval, and a is the real caring one. while i got people souvenirs/ food because i really thought of them during the trips, and i want to share how delicious the food is with them. it's all good intention and when i'm doing it, i'm not really caring but a is?... i explained i don't feel nice hearing that. k said he didn't mean a is more interesting than me. i asked him if he could maybe, knowing how a symbolizes something very important to trigger me, not to talk about her too nicely in front of me? k insists he won't, because that's unfair, and he wants me to understand that i have to accept some people just get closer but not with me, i have to accept that sometimes there are no reasons or answers why someone is more likable to some people. i understand he did this with good intentions and it's for my own good that i can overcome my insecurity and self-esteem issue, but i still found it harsh and somehow cruel when he knows i still have feelings for him, and he's talking nicely about another younger female. i don't know how to get out of this mindset and this is killing me. when i woke up this morning, the first thing i thought of was when he said 'she is interesting'... just to be clear, i might be jealous, but i don't want to be her, i know my own strength, i know how good i am. the frustration is from me not getting why. what has she done that people acknowledge her so much and can see her values so much? how is the way she expresses and carries herself that i failed so much? i mean she seems emotionally healthy and stable (which is another knife for me as i didn't choose to have bpd), but i don't get why, and i wish there was some comfort for me, for my very very hard path coming to this country, way harder than hers. i deserve so much, i've experienced life very thoroughly, i'm a writer myself and proud of dealt with all the difficulties. but look how one conversation about a has got me into a very depressive state... i don't know what to do. i'm hoping for some advice but more importantly, being listened to. this article is ridiculously long, i'm so sorry, thank you for reading it.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.00396235760277365,0.004457652303120356,0.09063893016344725,5.0,0.0
"my boyfriends bad breath may be a figment of my imagination and it's running our relationship i 23 m have been dating my partner 22m for the past 6 years. about a year ago we moved in together and i began to notice his breath smelled. it is important to know that i'm autistic and something i'm very sensitive to is smells. i tend to have reactions to any strong smell good or bad. due to this i was unable to kiss him or have sex face to face or even just cuddle with his face too close to mine. once he realised i was doing this he asked me why and i confessed i thought he had bad breath. he said he brushes every day and flosses so it's not poor hygiene and decided to go to the dentist to double check. the dentist said his teeth and gums were healthy and she couldn't smell any bad breath from him leaving us all confused as to what it is that i am smelling. i feel horrible, it's been months and i still smell it when his face gets to close to mine, i try to pretend i don't because it clearly hurts his feeling but i do and it's impacted our ability to be intimate and do things like kiss. the only logical conclusion i can come up with is that it's a figment of my imagination because i cannot think of anything else that would cause me to be smelling something nobody else can smell. this situation is clearly hurting his feelings i have no idea what to do, any advice would be appreciated. tldr: i'm the only person who thinks my long term partner has bad breath including his dentist leading me to believe it's a figment of my imagination and it's lead to a lack of intimacy between us.",advice,0,1598.0,311.0,2.0,0.006430868167202572,0.003215434083601286,0.10289389067524116,0.0,0.0

"mother is becoming the most negative force in my life i am the only child (f22) to my mother (f47) and father. background: my relationship with my mother has always been strained from a young age. she constantly micromanaged my life during the time that i lived under my parents roof. i had to get straight a’s and turn in all of my assignments, or else i was met with screaming, berating, and the silent treatment for weeks at a time. she was my team mom for my 4 years of high school, despite me telling her that i thought it was negatively effecting our relationship. she would even berate me at home if she didn’t like the way i interacted with my teammates. we just generally never got along, and fought the majority of my young life. my father says i was an exceptionally well behaved kid from age 0 to 18, when i moved out. he always tells me how proud he is of me, and that he wishes my mother would’ve been less harsh on me growing up and she would’ve seen how good of a kid i was. i was never a rebel. i always tried my best to do what my mother wanted. after i moved out, our relationship seemed to improve by miles! we saw each other once a week for dinner, rarely argued, and had mostly positive conversations until about 4-6 months ago. as of recent, she has seemed incredibly cold, distant, and negative in regards to me. when i tell her i’m struggling mentally with something or am seeking advice, she essentially tells me to get over myself. always. when i share my positive life updates and exciting news, she always finds ways to say something negative, or somehow dulls my excitement. she has even started canceling plans with me for people i’ve never even heard her talk about. my dad also tells me all she does is complain about me when i call her to check in and chat. i am genuinely hurt. when i confront her about how i feel, she usually gaslights me and finds a way to absolve herself of any blame. for a while, i even thought this was all my fault. do i have a narcissistic mother? how do i set boundaries? is there a way to fix this? tldr: my mom’s negativity is effecting my life. i want to save the relationship, but don’t know how. seeking advice.",advice,0,2178.0,417.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14388489208633093,3.0,0.0
"how to handle my bf criticizing how i treat my dog? hi friends, hope you are all well :) i, f(25), have been seeing this guy for the past 2 months (i said bf in the title but we aren't official yet). he's been to my place several times and each time he comes over he goes on and on about how i'm ""abusing"" my dog. before you jump to conclusions, he says this because i spoil my dog... a lot. i adopted my baby, cookie, from a local rescue shelter earlier this year, he was a very timid & scared puppy due to past neglect & abuse but when i met him, he crawled into my lap and fell asleep. i knew he was the one. since then we have developed this wonderful bond, i can't even explain it. i love him so much. here is a list of things i have done that this guy has classed as abuse: 1. due to past trauma, cookie had a hairless patch on his tummy so i would put little dog sweaters on him so he wouldn't get cold. the patch grew back in full within weeks of coming home with me, but he still insists on wearing the jumpers. truth be told, i think we both enjoy it. he has a whole collection of jumpers, hoodies, tshirts, bow ties, for some reason he just seems to enjoy it and i enjoy matching him with my outfits, he looks adorable. i am learning to knit and crochet so i can make him jumpers. 2. apparently cookies night routine is ""abusive"", it consists of a bubble bath (with dog safe products only, and a lil bonnet on to protect his ears) , blow dry, massage, cuddles, and then most nights i will rock him to sleep in my arms. i know this sounds silly but, i don't care, if my baby wants to be rocked to sleep i'm going to rock my damn baby to sleep 😂 3. i had a birthday party for cookie, other dogs from the neighbourhood showed up, there were balloons, party hats, cake for the babies & the adults, giftbags of dog toys, etc. it was so much fun. according to him this is ""weird."" every holiday is a reason to celebrate with cookie, for christmas he's an elf and he gets his own christmas dinner, for valentines day i bake him cupcakes, for easter he's a bunny and i take him on an easter egg hunt, etc. 4. when we are on a walk but he's feeling tired i'll put him in one of those dog carrier harnesses and carry him on my chest (he's very small). he is very attached to me and always wants to be around me or held (i work remotely so this is not a problem) so i'll put him in one of those baby wrap carrier things that you wrap around yourself with him on my chest, he will either sleep or just vibe with me. apparently i'm ""spoiling him"" like, just let me love my son? 😂 5. i commissioned an artist to paint cookie with a little suit & glasses on reading a newspaper, i will display it in my hallway when it arrives. every few months i paint one of his little paws and do a paw print in my scrapbook which is full of photos of him on our many travels. there are other things as well like how much money i spend on him, how much time i spend preparing his meals, etc. i would understand if he expressed it in a ""hey i'm feeling a bit neglected"" kind of way, if i was, for example, focused on my dog whilst we were supposed to be spending time together, but he says it's not that, it's that i treat my dog like a human baby and that's bizarre. i don't really understand this. everyone who has ever seen me with my dog always mentions how happy and healthy cookie looks, how obvious it is that we love eachother and that it's clear he is well taken care of. cookie was found in a bin, he was left there to die in the cold, now he's getting nightly spa treatments, holidays, gourmet meals and being loved how he deserves to be loved. i don't see anything wrong with this and the comments are annoying me, i've asked him to stop and he won't, just need a bit of guidance & advice on how to handle this? thank you in advance! tldr: guy i'm seeing keeps criticizing how spoiled my dog is. editted to add: i know that, unfortunately, cookie cannot live forever, so i have decided that after his passing i will have his ashes turned into a beautiful stone on a ring i will always wear. i found several companies that offer this service. apparently it's ""weird"" but i honestly think it's wonderful, and i will definitely go through with it. cookie has brought me more joy than i can put into words, the ring feels like a loving tribute in rememberance of my best friend. update: i dumped him (the guy not cookie), i would rather be with someone who loves animals as much as i do and who respects the love i have for my pet :) thanks everyone!",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,2.0,0.0022727272727272726,0.013636363636363636,0.09204545454545454,3.0,0.0
"my ex best friend is trying to form contact again sorry for a long post in advance. also i'm on my mobile. also english is not my first language. so. me(f23) and susan(f24) had been best friends for 10 years. during those 10 years there were moments where she was a shitty friend. for example, there has been a period where she cut off contact with me for 3 months because she started hanging out with this wannabe elite group and i wasn't cool enough and my family didn't have enough money so they gave her an ultimatum - either me or them. she chose them and after three months sent me a text as if nothing happened and we continued our friendship. we briefly mentioned it a couple of times after but never really talked about it, but she did say she was sorry and that she was stupid for losing me. some people later told me that during that period she tried to hook up with almost every guy i mentioned was cute. i don't think that is true but i also never asked.that was high school. other examples are that every time she would meet a new guy, she would forget that i existed. but i got used to it and i knew that she would come around after a couple of weeks. also almost every time i would be happy because of something that happened to me or because of something i did, she wouldn't necessarily ruin it for me but i could tell she wasn't truly happy for me. on the other hand, i would always be happy for her, i considered her success my success. when i started dating my now ex boyfriend she would have these little comments about me being lucky i met him first and would go on little lunches just the two of them. after i told him that it bothered me he cut their contact to minimum. i didn't mention anything to her because i knew it would lead to her gaslighting me. my mother and some of my other close friends never liked her, but i would always have her back. or would just stay quiet. she also had a weird competiton with my younger sister(f10) for my attention when the three of us would hang out at the park or at home. another thing worth mentioning is that a couple of years ago she cheated on her then boyfriend whom i was friends with and left it up to me to tell him that. then later got mad that i was sometimes still hanging out with him because he is her ex (tbf i met him when they started dating but we became good friends later) and would constanty tell me that she would never still be friends with my ex boyfriends, which wouldn't bother me btw unless they did something bad or wrong to me. the list goes on and on but 10 years of that can't be put in one post. i guess you are now wondering why was i ever even friends with her. the thing is, she is my soul sister. i have never laughed with someone as much as i have laughed with her. i knew that at every given moment i can be 110% myself in front of her in all the ways imaginable. she would always say out lound the things that i would think in my head but was nice enough not to say them out loud. she would have my back all the time. if someone ever said something bad about me behind my back she would get in a legitimate fight and would cut them off. we didn't have to talk to know what the other one was thinking and feeling. also she is an extrovert and i am an introvert who has trouble making friends at first, i'm not good with new people. there were times when i was younger where i had trouble even paying for coffee by myself and things like that. she would alway help me, offer to do it for me and introduce me to new people she met wihout me ever asking. she was my best friend in the entire world. she would just get me and i would get her. after a while i didn't even think of her as my friend, she was my sister. if i ever needed her (during periods we were okay) at any time of day or night, she would be there and bring pizza or something. if you have ever had the bestest friend in the world, you will know what i am trying to describe. also she comes from a broken home, i have perosnally been there to see how much her mom doesn't give a shit about her and her father doesn't live with them, fogets her birthday and they see each other only when he has to buy her new clothes or shoes or something. she's not good at communicating her feelings but she has often told me that she is very greatful for me, that she understands that she is a shitty person sometimes and that she realizes that not many people would forgive her for her behavior so many times like i did. now, in april 2022 she started dating this guy and of course she forgot about me. but this was the first time i got mad and was hurt because i was going through something personal and i really needed her to be here for me. and i said fine, lets see how much time we will go without contact if i don't initiate one. and it has been 8 months. at first i was heartbroken. sad. angry. i missed her like crazy. i still do but it has gotten better, now it's just when i hear a song we used to sing or when i see something funny that was an inside joke. it felt like (and is still feeling) like i'm going through a break up. i tried to figure out if it was something i had done because at one point it was obvious that she does not want contact. in few moments of weakness i invited her for a cup of coffee and she either just never opened a message or there was one time she said yes and never showed up. the last time we saw each other was in the middle of may at a mutual friend's birthday, she came with the guy she's seeing and we had minimal conversation. and now, at the end of december i'm supposed to see her again, again at a mutual friend's. honestly, i'm having mild panic attacks just at the thought of it but i also don't want not to go and see my other friends just because of her. i also didn't say anything about it to most of the people that are gonna be there. and in the last couple of weeks she started texting me again, it's just random memes or one word instagram story replies, but last week she invited me for coffee. i said i was busy but the truth is, i'm really scared that if we talk, that i will once again look past everything that she had done and forgive her (not forget though). i know i am weak for her, and some friends told me they always felt like we were some kind of a on again - off again toxic couple. people in my life get angry at me when i say i miss her because of the way she treated me but that's because they love me. i need some advice on what i should do and how i should act. tdlr: my ex best friend was a shitty friend and went no contact with me for 8 months wich really hurt me but now, just before we are supposed to see each other again, she's texting me again and wants to meet

(context: i made it very clear before we even started going out that the one thing i could not get over was being lied to.) i got over it though, for her. at the time it was worth it because i understood where she was coming from. but over time this withholding of information just never stopped. i kept trying to get over it and move on and thus we got 2 years deep and very attached. i don’t know what to do. how do people get through this feeling? how do you get over it? i’m a good looking guy and i never have had an issue getting girls but even so, she was the first one i ever wanted. my first everything. i feel like i just killed my best friend. i hope i don’t regret this. but deep down i know it had to be done. i’m not here seeking justification for breaking things off. i know it had to be done. we left off on that she would wait for me. i know this girl loves me to death and i feel the same about her. but shes just not good for me. she says these things and she acts a certain for a little while then shit goes back to the way it was until we almost break up again. this time i want it to be the last. i think i’ll always love her but the future that i see with her is terrifying and far from what i want in my life. will things change? i doubt it. i knew that we wouldn’t make it the home stretch from the beginning but i always turned a blind eye to those feeling. maybe it was the feeling of scarcity? i still am scared that i will never find anything like this again. even if i do find it, who’s to say it’ll be any different than this time. i guess my question is for those that have been in the same situation as me. particularly the one older than me. after turning 24 i feel as though my time is running out. i want someone to grow old with. i don’t want to find someone when i’m old… how did yours pan out? how did you move past it? do you regret it? i’ll be back in the gym sometime this week so don’t suggest that lol. i’m not the clubbing type of guy either, nor do i want to download tinder. i have no interest in hoeing out. i just want to go back to normal. tldr; i broke up with my girl last night and we had our final conversation over the phone this morning. i never had an interest in girls until i met her. but i know she’s not the one for me. how do i get over this?",advice,0,2610.0,555.0,6.0,0.010810810810810811,0.009009009009009009,0.12792792792792793,5.0,0.0

"we're both just exhausted. my (31m) wife's(33f) mom died on halloween. and it was a pretty rough ride to that day. she had cancer and really went downhill over about 4 months. during that time, my wife left our home and stayed with her mom 2 states over. it was pretty much staying at a friend's empty house with our 2yo son and visiting the hospital every day. our son stayed with her dad who was divorced from her mom many years ago while my wife was at the hospital. during all this, i had to stay home as we couldn't afford for me to take off work. my wife babysits for work 2-3 days a week...really just depending on what she feels like, so she was able to stop. we barely scrape by financially with that. and this lasted from mid-july to early september. in august i took the leave i had already scheduled for my birthday to go on a trip with friends and went to stay with her there for a week to support instead. in mid september, she came back because i had a week-long training in another state. when i got back, she left again, this time leaving our son with me for 2 weeks. i balanced caring for him while also working remotely during a high-demand period at my job. i did what was immediate and put the rest off best i could. when she finally came home, i worked late frequently trying to catch up at work. i'm a bit specialized and there's a good amount i can't hand off, even if someone else could, they wouldn't have the time. it's a pretty intense job. we were all together at home for a week or so and her mom passed away. there's a lot of drama in between i missed between her step-dad being absolutely insufferable. he slandered my wife to the family and her mom didn't want to be around him. part of the reason she stayed in the hospital. her mom transferred herself to a 3rd state where her sister and my wife's sister live. and she died there a day before my wife's scheduled flight to go with our son. it was another 2 weeks until the funeral, and i flew out for 3 days over a weekend. we still have only had one weekend where something hasn't been happening with my job or with other family passing through. i was gone all of last week on training. i stayed up from 7 am -10pm working everyday trying to catch up during training in the day. what isn't occupied, i have to spend working on our second car to keep it operable. we can't afford a shop to do it for us. we're financially, mentally, emotionally, physically exhausted. i'm exhausted....i'm now still a month behind in my work, and entering the busiest time of year along with low staff and doing 3 people's worth of work. i have nothing left. i can't support any more and there's no one to support me. i'm alone without family on this side of the country. no friends as we've only lived here for 1.5 years. my wife and son are it. through all of this, my wife expressed she wanted someone to talk to, like a therapist. i did a lot of research trying to find someone and found several that could help, but she didn't want to make an appointment. i don't know what to do or how to support her. i can't handle it anymore. as you can imagine, our sex life is non-existent. honestly, it was never great to begin with. she's never been one to initiate sex and rejects me 9 times of 10. she thought scheduled sex would help. she said she's had trauma in the past with partners forcing her when she doesn't want to. i've never done that, ever. i hate the schedule. i'm not into it, and it makes me feel like she's just doing it to appease me as she does even less in bed. our sex life has always been me giving to her, but now she doesn't want it, and she's not giving either. this isn't just her mom, it's been this way and getting worse since the start. in the meantime she's always been disagreeable and admits she does it without realizing. just saying the opposite to make an disagreement about little things all the time. she says it's about voicing an opinion, but it's really not, when it's about factual things or stupid little things. it's about saying something different than me. i usually let it go and let her have whatever she's saying...even if it's wrong and i know it. it's better than fighting about it. right now i can't handle it. it's driving me nuts. all along i want to support her because i know she's still in pain after only a month and a half since her mom died, but it's getting really difficult. i'm at the end of my rope and there's still noone there. i feel like she doesn't realize that this whole thing has affected me too. and i'm still paying for it.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,7.0,0.008073817762399077,0.006920415224913495,0.07497116493656286,0.0,0.0

"i think i made my boyfriend clingy i am fairly new to relationships and in this case i’m not sure if it was my fault or if he (my boyfriend) is just like this. ever since we first started talking, he would text me. i know that’s normal, and at first i was fine with it. the problem is that it’s been happening daily: before school sometimes (we’re both in highschool), after school on the bus (we have separate buses), maybe even a few hours after that-all of this was daily (it’s been at least a week and a half) and it’s draining. the second problem is that he misses me, a lot. he never told me this before we started dating, but the second day of our actual relationship he started with the ‘i miss you’ texts. for every day after school, he’s repeatedly texted me saying that he misses me. he also tries to involve himself with whatever i’m doing whenever he can. i’d say that we only see each other about 3 times a day and that’s somewhat minuscule, but i also like to spend time with my friends and i don’t know how i feel about him trying to replace time that i usually spend with my friends. i don’t know if i’m the cause of this sudden change (possibly through something unintentional that i haven’t taken notice of), but it’s been so socially draining for me and i’m starting to fear that he likes me a lot more than i like him.",advice,0,1339.0,273.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13186813186813187,0.0,0.0

"my boyfriends (m18) family is abusive towards him and he is okay with it. how do i (f18)deal with all that? (will probably post on other subs too) sorry if it‘s too long, but i really need advice. my boyfriend (m18) and i(f18) are deeply in love with each other. he is the best boyfriend one could imagine. since we got together a few months ago we have been hanging out 24/7- sleeping over at each other’s every night, spending every free minute together. i love him so deeply. he has been severely mentally ill, but is a lot better now. he is often insecure and questions my love for him- but even that has gotten a lot better (happens less and less severe). some of his mental struggles can be tracked back to his father leaving him at a young age and his family overall. his family is my main concern. his mothers and older sisters behavior are (as i see it) emotionally abusive. they blow small things (forgetting to do laundry once) out of proportion and fight with him for hours over it- saying he doesn’t care about them because he forgot something. when he tries to reason with them, they twist the meaning of his words and make him out to be the asshole when they are just too self centered and stubborn to try to get his point. my boyfriend often has panick attacks when arguing with them as they basically scream at him and tell him how egoistical he is for whatever he has done (most of the time it s something small he forgot or something he has no control over (being late because the train wasn’t on time etc)) they also used to humiliate him when he was in a state of panick and didn’t react to anything, to at least get some kind of reaction from him (slapping, insulting etc). when he has those panick attacks they generally keep on screaming at him and don’t seem to really care (they say he fakes them for manipulation, but he really does not) yesterday they had a fight again. his mother found out that he has been lying to her about going to the gym. he tried to explain her that he didn’t trust her enough to tell her that he felt awful going there, and that he was scared that she wouldn’t understand his reasoning and be mad about it. they argued for a pretty long time when his sister also started to fight with him- saying he has no respect at all and how awful of a human being he is. i was waiting in his room and heard them fight for at least 3hours no end. he then had s huge panick attack again and i went down to them to try to calm him down and help him. i didn’t intend to intervene somehow- at the end of the day it s none of my business- i just wanted to calm my boyfriend down as he often wants me there when he has panick attacks. his sister started to comment on me in a passive aggressive way saying to stay out of their business and how he doesn’t need me there etc. i tried to ignore her and just be there for him till he calmed down. she said it was only okay for me to be there if i left after he calmed down so they could keep on „talking“. so that s what i had to do after. they kept on arguing, and his mother joined back into the conversation. i heard how they screamed at him from both sides and it was so loud and everything. he had a panick attack again. i tried to go there to help him but they wouldn’t let me in, telling me that if he wanted to leave the situation that he was free to leave at all times (when he has panick attacks he can’t stand up or move). they belittled me saying the door is closed for a reason and to not always get into their business. i felt so helpless and didn’t know what to do. i went to his room again and from there heard him crying and screaming. it hurt so much to hear all that. i myself had a panick attack because i was so worried and so hurt hearing him like that. i sadly relapsed (sh) that moment because i didn’t know how else to get the panick out of my head. he came to the room a few minutes later. he seemed calm and told me that everything was fine and tried to soothe me (i didn’t tell him about my sh relapse). we fell asleep a little bit later (after 4hours of fighting) today morning i woke up and felt weird. i was worried for my boyfriend and generally felt anxious in their house. i used to be okay with his mother and sister, but i m scared of them since today. i told him that i wanted to leave and go home as soon as possible and he said okay but that he wants to stay there a little bit longer. i couldn’t understand how he wanted to be there even longer than he had to. he seemed weird so i asked if everything were okay and he said that he doesn’t get how i could hate his family that much. he told me that he s just okay with them and is confused by my strong feelings against them (i have always hated them and he knows, not just because of yesterday- i never show them though). i was confused. i told him i don’t get how he can be okay with them even though they treat him like shit- they may buy him small things but most of the time they don’t really talk. i get that they did a lot for him (paid for his therapy and other stuff), but he is also so grateful that they let him live there, do some of his laundry, cook. and yes sure, they do that, but does that make a family a family- does so little make one love their family? he said it s okay for me to go home and that he ll soon come too, he just wants to stay a bit. so i left with mixed feelings. i told him that i was scared of his family. he knows how they treated me (he said they won’t treat me this badly from now on (he thinks!!)). and i just don’t know. i was so scared of the whole situation yesterday even though he says that it happens sometimes and is nothing new to worry about. i will still worry, and i will still be hurt when i hear his crying and screams of pain. and even though a situation like that one has happened before, it wasn’t as extreme. i don’t know how many times more i can hear his panick attacks and have a breakdown myself. it pained me so much i even relapsed after being fine for nearly half a year. i don’t know how much more often i can be there to reassure him that he ll be okay and that he ll be fine when he himself doesn’t seem to see how bad it is. it is just so much and i don’t know how to handle it. i love him so very much- he is the love of my life. there is not one thing bad about him- he is the kindest, funniest, most caring, most lovable person ever. i don’t ever want to lose him. yet his situation at home is breaking me. i want to be there for him but i don’t know how much more i can take of this. what do i do? how should i feel about this? please somebody

"i now outlast my girlfriend & i hate it sooo long story short: i've (25m) been with my girlfriend for a long time now and our sex life has always been pretty good but it used to take a lot of effort on my end not to reach the finish line too early. in the last 3 months i decided to actively work on this & i've now gone too far the other way and can't seem to go back, so much so it's starting to affect our sex life. the best way to describe it is that before i would get to say 80-95% of the way to the end zone for myself very quickly due to just enjoying the horizontal tango so much. i would then maintain this while getting her to her destination as best i could & praying it'd happen sooner than later. the result of this was that all our sex felt like a challenge to me (she's there aiming to have the best time she can, i'm trying to put in a performance). since i'm fitness minded i decided to apply some self improvement on the mental side to control my excitement & for a few weeks it was the best sex we've ever had. i could simply hold my excitement at wherever i wanted, then finish whenever i desired. it honestly felt like a super power. however now i've gone too far. she finishes & i'm barely 50% of the way there with no control to finish when i want. my partner is also a ""one & done"" type of girl when it comes to orgasms in sex, to the point where if we try to go much longer after she finishes she says she gets too sore & a second orgasm is very very rare. she says this is because i'm on the ""larger side"" and she just can't take it that much, as when she masturbates she's able to have ""more but less intense orgasms"" using her hands. (backhanded compliments championship contender 2022?) i think because we've had a few experiences where she's had to throw in the white flag after she's finished it's made the experience even worse as now every time we start to get down there is an anxious cloud over how it will end. i've tried to be polite & i say it's fine but it is really frustrating me now. has anyone had similar experience? i know this post sounds like a ridiculous problem (help i literally can't stop out-sexing my partner) but it has ruined sex for me. i thought i was missing out on fun when i struggled to last but it turns out the grass isn't greener over the fence. is this the ""sexual compatibility"" problem i see mentioned here often? i keep wondering if we're not such a good match anymore as a result of this.

"my mother is absent and i don't know why i'm (17) f and my mother is maybe mid 30s now. i live with my dad in australia and my mother is originally from america. she moved to australia when she got married to my dad, who is in his late 40s now. when i was born my mother only stayed in australia with us for two years before she met someone else she fell in love with online and divorced my dad before leaving to america. she let my dad have full custody. my dad got her to skype with me often after she left and that was my main way of talking to her before she moved back to australia with her new husband who i'll call mark for privacy sake, i don't know his age or anything about him, because she doesn't talk to me. she came back to australia when i was 7 or 8 and we had a custody agreement that she would let me visit her house every second weekend, and i'd often play with my legos or laptop when i was over and she was very distant with me and often not very understanding. i love my mum but as a kid i sometimes i didn't want to go over there, but now it's all i want. for more detail, id normally sleep over and arrive on saturday and leave on sunday morning. over the years she started seeing me less and less, to the point where she would lie to get her child support payments less, like saying she was earning less than she was and was seeing me more than she actually was, it ended up in her oweing us a thousand or so in child support. first it was only seeing her for holidays like easter or thanksgiving and then it was just christmas and my birthday. last time i saw her in person for christmas was 2019, i just want to spend time with my mum, she use to take me to the movies during my birthday but she doesn't anymore, which i understand if it isn't in her budget anymore but i would like to just come over, i haven't technically been in her house since 2018. my dad suggested messaging her so i would normally send her messages on christmas, mothers day, her birthday ((which i only know the month and day because i saw it on my birth certificate)) and etc, but she never responds to my messages, and it got to a point where she wouldn't even talk to me on my birthday but would finally pay child support as a gift. i don't even want a gift i just want a message and i'm not too sure what i did, and even said sorry to her once just in case. all i know is she had some issues with her own mother in the past and to put it lightly she was quite abusive. my mother also may have social anxiety and i myself have been recently diagnosed with it. i want to message her this year for christmas but i don't want to come off as desperate, i've been a lurker for a while and have been wanting to podt for a while to see other peoples thoughts on this. if anyone has any advice on if i can salvage this relationship i'm open to peoples opinions. tldr: mother ignores my text messages and no longer sees me at all ever since 2019, not sure if i should continue trying or not.",advice,0,2987.0,592.0,4.0,0.006756756756756757,0.008445945945945946,0.10135135135135136,0.0,0.0

"i'm in love with my friend, who's in a relationship, but likes me too. we've complicated things to a massive extent and i'm now at a loss. i *\[31f\]* have a friend, jake *\[29m\]* who i met almost 10 years ago through a mutual friend. this wil be long, unfortunately. **tldr at the bottom.** thanks for reading <3 when i met jake, we were both single, i had just gotten out of a very toxic relationship and was only looking for casual fun (you know the drill). we had sex once and made plans to meet again in the future, and meanwhile he had introduced me to this group of guys/friends that played the same online game i played, so we started all playing together. i'd spend so much time skyping him, we were young and had so much time anyway. i liked him already, but as much as you can like some one you don't really know, after you've just exited a 2-year-nightmare. he was also sort of seeing a girl, sandy *\[28f\]*, and i very strongly remember him telling me he was not really into her etc. i'd also skype with another guy from the gaming group, alex *\[31m\]*, who soon asked jake if there was something going on between us and if it'd be ok to persue something with me and jake said 'go ahead'. i ended up dating alex for about 8 years, only breaking up in dec 2021. jake is still dating sandy. during all this time we were each dating our sos, we didn't really remain friends. i remember in the begining, i tried being his friend like we used to be, but he wasn't really trying back so we fizzled out, went on with our lives and our new relationships and we'd only casually play the game with the group. when i broke up with alex, we tried remaining civil and friendly, so when we'd plan meetups with the guys from the group, we'd both attend and everything was fine. until it wasn't, obviously. alex asked for some time complete no contact with me, so i just backed off from everything, i let him have all the mutual friends and hobbies etc. one day, jake dms me to ask if i'm available for a meetup on a friday. i tell him what's up with alex, so they should just make plans among themselves for now and maybe i'll be joining in the future when alex was over it. he said it won't be fun without me, i said sorry and that we could at least play the game sometimes so we'd hang like that. so we start casually talking a bit more, until one day he comes over my house to drop off something i asked for, and we ended up chilling for \~7 hours, just talking. that day, he said he was planing on taking it to the next level with sandy, probably within the next couple of years. after that, we began talking increasingly over the next few weeks. i introduced him to my best friend, emma *\[30f\]*, who instantly liked him (she mentioned he was very good looking, that's all she said to me) and i would talk with him almost every night until morning. i later found out that most of those nights, he would leave sandy to sleep and chill/talk with me. there was an undenyable chemistry between us, and a sexual tension (we talked about sexual stuff a lot, just conversation though, no phone sex or anything like that). he gradually started saying he had *doubts* about sandy, that he doesn't feel like he wants to be with her anymore. emma commented once or twice that it's weird too, but that's all. now, i have some mild audhd and i know it's not an excuse, it just takes me some time to process things and realize what's going on. i'm also used to having guy friends and talking about all sorts of stuff, so it took me some time to realize that what's happening between us is not normal. i brought it up once, saying it's weird he talks to me for hours while he doesn't want to spend any time with sandy. i also started to *suspect* i had a crush on him, but i didn't know what to do about it, i couldn't tell anybody either (he had a gf, i mean, i was ashamed..) towards the end of summer, emma and i threw a party. it was great at first, i had invited jake too with a couple of his friends, we had a nice time. at some point, a guest made me extremely uncomfortable and i wanted to step out for a minute. long story short, jake came with me and we ended up sitting out for 2 hours talking. well.. he also made sort of a move on me, telling me he'd be breaking up with sandy the next day when i was like ""wtf u doin"". he repeated this many times, we were drunk/high enough and i didn't really need much to just let go. we missed the end of the party, ended up at my place having sex *(fun fact- we never kissed)*. horrible, i know, i am super ashamed and i've hated myself for a while now because of that. next day, we sobered up and he realized he'd have to live with the *consequences* now. would you look at that! we decided to cool it. of course he didn't break up with sandy. the worst part for me at the time wasn't jake/sandy, it was *emma*. she completly dropped me. we had been friends for *16 years* at that point, and she just.. dropped me. she thought i left the party with jake to make her mad, or jealous, or something insane like that, she thought it was somehow about her, and no matter what i said she had made up her mind. it was the worst breakup of my life, especially because she wasn't clear with me, i had to just try and try and try to talk, to make up, to fix it, until i just gave up because she didn't care anymore but just wouldn't be straight with me. jake and i started talking again and hanging out again. we never talked about that night or anything between us ever again, and it was really helpful to have him as a friend during the emma breakup. it's now been 3 months that we've been hanging **a lot**. (he almost broke up with sandy twice during that time, btw, but the key word here is -almost-.) but last month i realized (late, again) that i have a damn crush on him. then i also realized it's even more than that and i can't be friends with him, i need some time to process it, get over it and move on before we could be friends again, so i let him know. i get my shit together and we start hanging out again. then he tells me he's into me too. it destroys all the work i put into dissociating and compartmentalizing. he says he's in a position where he must **pick between** ***me*** **and** ***sandy***. he said that after hanging out with me, he went from 'ring shopping' to 'how to break up'. he referred to what we have as ""*platonic*"" and even admitted it was sort of an *emotional affair* (it's all obvious now to me, but it wasn't then, if that makes sense? maybe i was just in denial, idk). again, i said that we should take some time apart because this won't end well and i value our friendship so so much, i wouldn't want to risk it. he said it'd make him sad to not have me in his life, and asked if i could give him some time to think. that ""some time"" would be *pretending nothing is going on and keep chilling like we used to*. i was like f it, fine, i don't want to stop hanging out with him either, it wasn't a hard decision. but it's a hard process for me now. now that he told me he likes me, now that he said he had to ""*pick*"" essentially, i just can't stop thinking about it all. he gave me '*hope*' and now it's so much harder. i know deep down he won't leave sandy, i know i'm just probably wasting my time, but i haven't felt like that since forever and i struggle to let it go. i need to be prepared for when the rejection comes, i just can't. i don't even know what to do. should i just quit it with him? i *agreed* to take some time, i can't just take that back. tonight we're going to a party together, emma will be there too. i had invited jake a week ago, he said he'd come, then when i didn't mention it again until 2 days ago, he said he thought i would go solo and said maybe it's better that way because if i were with him, it'd be harder to ""*meet guys*"". like telling me i should ***not*** wait for him, but he literally asked me to wait... i'm so confused. i've only told a couple of friends, a married couple, but they love me and they see how stuck i am, so i don't think they're giving it to me straight. they said they believe he said that about the party to see how i'd react (i told jake i invited him as a friend, not as a date, and i'll do whatever i want to do **if** i wanted to do it). reddit, what do i do? he's the best friend i've had, but i'm also in love with him. how do i salvage this? am i setting myself up for failure/hurt here? i usually build such strong walls to protect myself, but now i'm lost. i hate the role i've assumed, i hate being ""*the other woman*"". i even criticized a friend heavily for having an affair with a guy, and now here i am, an entire hypocrite writing a bunch of stupid words for a stupid problem that **i created**. it's all so effed up. i'm so sorry for sandy, i'm so sorry for alex and i'm so embarassed with myself, i wanted to be a good person, not some one who causes problems. i miss emma, and i already miss jake, or more accurately, i miss what i would like to have with him. i've never felt that way. leave or wait? can we be friends again after all that? has anyone been through anything similar? &#x200b; **tldr** \- i'm crushing hard on my buddy, he has a gf. he told me he likes me too, but he needs time to sort it out. i'm trying to distance myself but, for the life of me, can't. i value our friendship very much, how can i salvage it?",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.007608695652173913,0.002717391304347826,0.09619565217391304,5.0,0.0

"can having crush warp your sense of reality? i've been crushing hard on a girl from my work the last few days, and i don't know if it's warped my perception of reality. long story short, there are three of us on a business trip. a male college of mine, the girl and myself. male college is married and 50 years old. girl has a boyfriend and is 30, i am 32. i started to notice that they were always kind of touching each other and having whispered conversations. the girl booked all the flights and the hotels, they were late arriving at check-in and before they got there. she asked me what floor i was on(which was 1), then the next morning i noticed they were both on two. i had a suspicion that they were staying in each others rooms because they never wanted me on their floor, they always went up to their floor together and came back down together. on lots of occasions when we were out at bars after work, i would walk away and if i turned round, they guy would start putting his arm around her. one thing is, the guy is very handsy when he is drinking. but last night i left our table to go to the bathroom. i went the wrong way and had to turn back. when i turned around he had his arm around her shoulder and was leaning into her. she noticed me coming back and she threw his arm off, almost like ""we can't let him see"" anyway, they both noticed i was acting weird. because i had lots of suspicions and i was crushing hard on her, so i was feeling sick and could barley look her in the eye. so i just straight up asked them if there was anything going between them. they both denied it and just said they were very close because they had been traveling together for work. anyway. in my head no, i am convinced that every night when they were going back up to their floor, they were fooling around with each other. or having a full affair. so i'm wondering, could i be imagining all of this? i'm literally love sick with her, all of a sudden my appetite disappeared, dry mouth, sore stomach, the whole thing. could my current state of mind be messing with me? i'm literally sitting thinking about every interaction they had and everything that happened over the past week, to figure out if something is going on, it's driving me insane.",advice,0,2246.0,427.0,2.0,0.00468384074941452,0.00468384074941452,0.07728337236533958,3.0,0.0

"how can i (36f) help my sil (40-sih f) and her kids? tldr; i (36f) just found out that my married with 3 kids oldest brother k (42m) is having an affair that's been going on for 1+ years, and i am unsure what to do. my mother called me and my other siblings to tell us that she had just talked to my sister-in-law m (40-ish f), who was crying, saying k's affair partner, ap (26-ish f), called her because **k told ap to contact m and to ask permission for them to get married!** not only is he repeating the exact thing my late father did to my mother, **he went and got ap to tell m instead of himself!** (according to m) backstory; my late father had an affair too. he was on a business trip and 7 year old me miss him. i called his accommodation number (no mobile phone back then), and a woman answered. the call abruptly ended, and when i called again, i ask who was that woman; my dad denied any woman. it didn't come much later that we found out he had an affair. this cause massive damage, but especially to my mother, who supported both him and his children through hard times, such as when he lost his jobs and refuses to work, so mom was the sole breadwinner for a time. they stayed together in the end (not sure why; love? shame? i was too scarred to ask). while he did finally pull himself together (mom actually left her job as she was sick of him refusing to look for one), he continues to pay more attention to other people rather than his own family; he will always help others and look after them, yet he left his own children to their own devices and siphon money from my mom (and later me) when his job didn't pay much yet his expenses and debt keep increasing. my mom found out one of the reason why he keeps lacking money is because he keep giving it away to other woman to help them, whatever it was, even though bills were mostly paid by mom (with me also contributing once i started working). back to current; my brother is following our late father's footsteps, only this time it is worst; 1. he's going for marriage while our late father (allegedly) didn't 2. m is a sahm, so she isn't financially independent, unlike my mom now, my religion may allow man to have more than 1 partner, and i have no problem with this because i believe it is a woman's right to marry a man who can provide for her, even if the man is already married, provided the following criteria is met; 1. the man is fully able to provide for his current family, and him marrying another will not jeopardize the current's family situation (e.g. they can continue to live as they are, with no reduction to comforts etc.) 2. the man is able to be fair to his family (wife and children) 3. the man receive permission and blessing from the current wife i find k sorely lacking in all these areas; 1. his current family isn't poor, but clearly could benefit with more money (for foods, bills, maintenance, and maybe a new computer for the kids). he has been giving ap and her parents money, **whereas our own mother doesn't get any**. k also have struggling younger siblings, whom he could helped (instead, me and our mom helped pay for their food). 2. he left m and the kids to be with ap and turn off his phone. one night, middle kid had trouble breathing. m tried to contact him but couldn't get through, so she woke the eldest to look after the youngest at the dead of night looking for any clinic that was open. he choose secrecy and leaving it to m to take care of **his kids** in case of emergency. 3. of course m refuses to give permission, so ap told her that they will elope to the neighboring country to get married (common for couples to do when the 1st wife doesn't give permission) i am seething mad because 1st it was my mother, now my own brother does it to another. m doesn't deserve this. she is sweet, nice and kind. she is a much better daughter compared to me to my mom (no hate from me, because she is a good person). the reason she is a sahm mom was because when their first kid was born, both of them were working, so they needed to find a babysitter. being first time parents, they were warry of leaving their child to strangers, so they asked my mom's maid to take care of their child (my parents were still working and me & the other siblings were studying, so no one was at home during the day). not sure how much they paid her (or if she was paid at all), but it went on till the maid's contract ended. they couldn't find anyone, so in the end, m decided to quit her job and become a full time sahm. they went off to have 2 more kids. currently, k is overseas in another country due to work, which will go on for few years. he was supposed to come back in february for a break, but told m that he won't be back. she suspect he's going to get married with ap during that time. m have been finding red flags here and there before (such as tissues with kiss mark, unknown hotel credit card charges), but k always denies it, saying it was his friends and such. now that her world is crashing down, me, my mom and other siblings doesn't know how to help m and the kids. we worry that k might do the unthinkable and abandon both m and the kids. it's why we don't dare to confront him right now. m doesn't have much savings. my mom is retired and her savings are dwindling (remember i have siblings who are struggling? well they're pretty much rely on her). as for me, i don't earn much and could at most support myself and my mom. k is still paying for the house m and the kids live in. the youngest kid is starting school next year. there's 3 kids. how can a single mother who left the workforce for so long be able to provide for them? i'm scarred. and also sad. for m and the kids. i'm tearing up cause it reminded me of so much of the pain we had to go through when my late dad's affair was revealed. he went for a woman in her 20s, and ap is around the same age too. i want to help m and the kids. i love the kids. the oldest will be devastated, while the other 2 is too young. if they have to move out, i will let them live in my house, but i don't know if m will take it, as it's near their current home. other than that, i don't know what else i can do to help them. i'm lost and a messed right now but m is surely having it worst. what can i do to help?

"my boyfriend has some old-fashioned values i don't agree with. i(21f) have been with my boyfriend (23m) for quite a while now. we are stable and often talk of a future together. i study film and media full time and will be graduating in six months. i also have a day job that from which i help with some of my little sister's school expenses. i'm trying to save up to buy an expensive video camera that i've been dreaming of forever. here's the thing, i go to college almost 2.5 hours away from where i live. it's close to where my boyfriend lives. it's exhausting to travel 5 hours almost daily but i make it work. my boyfriend strongly suggests i move out somewhere closer to college and to him so things will be easier for me. at first, i loved the idea but soon i realised that it's going to be really expensive with the rent and maintenance and other bills. i share these expenses with my mom at home. things are slightly tight for us financially. my mom is a single mom and has been the only breadwinner for our family both before and after my dad passed. so this set-up works for us. i told my boyfriend i wont be able to move out very soon, stating it's difficult and moving out will leave no scope for me to save up for the camera or have any emergency savings either. he said it's okay if i don't want to, but still often talks about how far away i live and how unsafe it is. i'm the one that mostly travels up to see him. in a recent casual discussion on the subject, i told him that i might be able to move once i graduate, get a raise, and buy the camera i've been wanting to. then i asked him if he would move with me at any point. he ignored the question. i asked again and he said i can live with him and his parents. i told him i can do that for maybe a couple weeks but i want to have my own home. no hard feelings for parents at all. im indian so women living with their partner's parents is like a old custom here although it's almost obsolete these days. i think i'm young, as is he, and we both have a long way to go. but it's kind of concerning to me that he thinks this way. i also noticed that he is really dependant on his parents. he asks permission for almost everything. he hides our relationship from them and it's not like we just started dating. it's been over a year. he's financially dependant on them currently but he says it won't be so for very long. i don't really mind any of this for most parts. i offer to help him as much as i can and he always supports me in my efforts too and i'm really grateful for that. but this particular discussion has worried me quite a bit. i've had super toxic relationships in the past. i suffer from a crippling amount of anxiety and i'm not sure if i'm overthinking this but i don't want to be in a relationship when there's probably already a dealbreaker. but i also feel like i'm thinking this way too much. i respect his choices and in no capacity do i want him to change his plans for me. but i can't help feeling like if i'm only postponing a breakup over this? edit: in a recent text, he wrote that he doesn't want to dump his parents after they've helped him so much. personally, i don't believe that moving out is 'dumping' parents. he also says that he thinks i resent him for not having a job, which i don't. i did find him a work from home job earlier this year but i also ended up doing most of the work for him. it got stressful with my own job and school so i stopped helping and he was fired soon after. since then, i have offered to pay for everything whenever we are spending time together. i have no problem doing this. however, i feel like none of this matters in the end. i don't want him to choose but i'm conflicted about what here is the right thing for me to do.",advice,0,3759.0,687.0,6.0,0.008108108108108109,0.0013513513513513514,0.1,1.0,0.0
"40m/35f starting to have feelings for a coworker who is currently in a relationship. to give additional detail to the title: i'm pretty sure i'm friend-zoned. we both get along super well. we make each other laugh and almost finish each other's sentences. she recently thanked me for being able to cheer her up even in her darkest moments. the more time i spend with her the more my feelings grow. she texts me regularly outside of work with all kinds of stuff. funny stuff, personal stuff... it's a really open exchange. trouble is, she's in a relationship. when we first met she was in a different relationship but that ended pretty badly and she quickly ended up in a new relationship. she seems happy even though she \*did\* complain about her new partner at times. on other days she tells me she ""lucked out with him"". so i'm getting somewhat mixed signals. but every relationship has ups and downs so i this is not surprising. i've been contemplating telling her how i feel. but we're working together.... closely. and that could be awkward for all kinds of reasons. no matter how that would go. i feel trapped. i have confidence that i can live with the current situation though. and just ""suck it up"". our company has a small psych/social-department at work who are there for these kinds of questions. i am reluctant to turn on them though because - even though there's confidentiality (the office is not even located at the headquarters) - i'm worried that this could make social events of the company awkward if i run into those guys while having her stand next to me at the same social event. another detail that adds to my predicament is the ""having kids"" question. i've not been super lucky with my past relationships because i'm not keen on having kids. and for my previous partners i've had this was a deal-breaker. a couple of weeks ago, we were having an after-office drink with a couple of co-workers and she was there too. during a discussion she let it slip that she also does not want any kids. i probably read too much into that. but she knows that i don't want any kids and now i'm not sure if she made that comment to let me know or if that was just part of the conversation without any afterthought. what are your thoughts on this?",advice,0,2256.0,413.0,1.0,0.002421307506053269,0.002421307506053269,0.05811138014527845,1.0,0.0

"bf going to college soon okay so my boyfriend and i have been together for a little over a year now. we went through a really rough patch because he had been cheating on me. i know most of you are probably thinking i’m crazy for staying, but those of you who have been through a similar experience hopefully know how hard it is to leave someone you love. we got through our rough patch and he’s been loyal to me for a while now. and the girl he cheated with was someone we both knew, it wasn’t just a stranger. but now he’s about to go to college next fall and he started following a bunch of people that are graduating the same year as him at that college. this is worrying me because he isn’t social at all. he keeps to himself a lot and only talks to a handful of people. he especially doesn’t use snapchat hardly ever unless it’s to keep streaks with me, and even then it was hard to convince him of that. so his snap score has been going up a ton recently and it was bothering me so much that i finally asked him. he told me that it was cause one of the guys he started talking to from the college page added him to this group chat and they had all been sending snaps in it. but then i wanted to check his story so i went to his following on instagram. he started following more girls than guys. a few of them had boyfriends, so it made it a little less worrisome. but there were some that did not have a boyfriend and they were very pretty. this was alarming to me because at one point we had broken up and he told me that once he goes to college he’s gonna meet tons of new people and he’s probably gonna find some beautiful girl that he falls in love with and that he will stay loyal to her due to caring about her more than me. that conversation was a very nasty fight and we both said some hurtful things and i was thinking he didn’t mean that but now i’m starting to get kind of worried. i wanted to share this with someone and ask, am i crazy? am i too worried? should i just trust him more or is he up to something? keep in mind as well that he barely follows any girls on instagram. mostly bowling and car accounts and a few people from our school but he has never followed any girls even before we got together. so can someone help me and tell me if i’m crazy or not? edit: i had told him i was worried and tried to have a conversation and maybe get a little reassurance but he straight up said “why does it matter” and he was being really defensive so that made me even more worried. that’s why i’m coming here and asking for help because he won’t give me a straight answer about any of it",advice,0,2605.0,535.0,2.0,0.003738317757009346,0.005607476635514018,0.07102803738317758,4.0,0.0

"how do i tell my bf that i do get hurt when he goes on tinder this is my first time posting and i really need some advice. i (27f) and my bf (32f) met on dating app and been together for 2 years and living together for 1 year. we are perfect in every aspect except one thing, he has a habit of going online on dating apps. in the beginning of the relationship, my friends caught him on bumble a couple times and i confronted him. he said it was for his ego boost and won’t do it again if it hurts me. i caught him flirting with girls on instagrams and he admitted he met them on tandem (language exchange app) and lure them into follow his instagram account. he explained that he gets flirty because it works the best to gain more followers on insta. i never believed this excuse and developed a bad habit of peaking into his phones to check if he is still doing it. this tandem thing is still ongoing after 2 years. sometimes i catch him texting girls for a long period of time, calling them sweet names and sending half naked selfies. i was deeply hurt and became insecure. we had many fights and long talks where i confront him about these and he calls me crazy and toxic for looking into his phone. we came to a conclusion that we both stop doing this. i still believe that he won’t actually cheat on me as we are together almost 24/7 and he only uses fake name and age online. i’m guessing it’s some sort of a habit he does when he is bored. ever since, i haven’t looked into his phone for a while until a random girl on instagram warned me that she talked to my bf on tinder. (he gave her his insta and she saw that he has photos of me there) i confronted and he denied it was him and that someone hacked his account. and now i was away for a trip for a week and it was as our first time apart. i came back to find he was on bumble, tinder, hinge and some random chat apps. (yes, i went through his phone again and i saw deleted email confirmations for the app’s account register) i know people usually advice to break up if the partner is constantly on dating apps. but i believe my bf isn’t actually looking for a new girl. he is genuinely happy with me and we have many upcoming plans together. we are great in all the other aspects and i don’t want to break up because of his bad online flirting habits. maybe the way i communicate has been wrong or ineffective. i want to have a talk with him about downloading all these apps while i was away. i want him to really underatand that this is the very last warning. if he really doesn’t improve, i cannot continue this relationship where i am not heard. i need advice on : 1. how do i make him understand that i consider online flirting as cheating too? ofc i told him all about it and my feelings but i feel like he doesn’t take any of my confrontations seriously. i cried, i tried to take a break but we are still here. 2. how do i stop going through his phone? how do i regain my trust for him? but at the same time, how would i know he is not doing it again? tldr: i have a bad habit of going through my bf’s phone and always catch my bf on online dating apps or flirting with girls on insta. all fights and confrontation is not stopping him. how do we both stop this vicious cycle?",advice,0,3243.0,645.0,3.0,0.004651162790697674,-0.004651162790697674,0.10077519379844961,5.0,0.0

"into 3rd week of no contact, trying to find clarity my ex (22f) broke up with me (24m) after ten months of amazing relationship. we did amazing stuff, we both cried of emotion having sex, talked about a future together, shared how we felt ""fulfilled"" or ""plenitude"" with the other person. our life goals were aligned, we were very attracted to each other (although she sometimes seemed less interested in sex than i was), our families loved the relationship, we share our main interests in life, felt very safe and connected... it overall seemed like a very fulfilling relationship. specially for her, i was the first true boyfriend she had and the only guy to meet her parents till now, the only one who has treated her right. she was the pursuer for the first 3 months or so. on the ninth month i could feel that the limerence was fading and the relationship was becoming a different thing from the volcano of emotion and desire that it was in the beggining; i had doubts myself about this person being the right one for me but could manage them well. three weeks before the breakup or so my gf started to get cold out of the blue in very subtle ways (less interest in sex, not so proactive to meet up, caused a couple calm arguments). after two more weeks of an increasing confusion in her mind, she was still having a lot of doubts and had developed a platonic emotional affair with a teacher of hers (despicable 40-something bald guy who pursues innocent students). this made things even more messy. i couldn't take it anymore, she wouldn't make a decision and the whole situation was slowly destroying my mental health. i really tried, but at some point we both saw that it was impossible, she couldn't make up her mind, clearly she couldn't be in a relationship with me having all these doubts and confusion about her emotions, although she said she loved me, she didn't want to lose me, she felt crazy and like this was a mistake, and she had been really depressed for two weeks. so we broke up. we came across each other some days after that (we go to the same college) and she seemed very sad, and so did i. we saw each other again to return the stuff we still had at each other's house. she still seemed very emotional two weeks into the breakup, and from the conversation we had i could tell that she missed me like crazy, she was still attracted to me and there was some romantic thing still alive within us. but she was confused still and we just kissed and hugged and said goodbye. one week later we came across each other again, and so i offered to go for some drinks in the evening. she accepted, and it was wonderful: we were lovebirds again, we could stop talking about the breakup and emotions and just be together again having a good time. then she said that she wanted to go back to no contact for some days and i accepted, i could see things steering in the right direction. one week later we came across each other in the train and she said she wanted me back. i said ""ok, i'm open to that"" and we agreed to meet up at mi place in the evening. she brought some biscuits as a make up gesture and seemed very insecure and anxious, really wanting me to take her back. so i profited on my just recovered power to talk about the relationship straight away (big mistake): i talked about the things i thought she had done wrong (initiating an emotional affair mainly, and not being clear at all about her emotions dragging me with her chaos). she seemed to understand, and said that the relationship with the teacher was over (it never was more than texting and having some talks at college. i know nothing happened between them, it was platonic all the way) and that she loved me and couldn't lose me. the rest of the conversation was wholesome about mending the relationship and about the things we liked and disliked in each other behaviour. we slept together and she asked me to be together again, and i agreed (big mistake, should have been more cautious and patient). during the next days, she slowly started getting more and more confused again. i acted somewhat needy, asking at some points how she was feeling. but then she told me that she was going to attend to a seminar where this teacher i mentioned is the moderator of student's presentations. i said that i didn't feel confortable with this, that i thought it was a mistake and she shouldn't do it (big mistake on my side: putting more pressure on an already under pressure relationship, acting insecure). then it was her birthday and i did a grand gesture kind of thing, renting an hotel room and filling it with candles, chocolates and a couple gifts. her words: ""i do not deserve to be treated this nicely by you (in tears)"". i said that it was just normal, it was her birthday and i wanted her to know how special she was. we had kind of a nice evening, slept together in the hotel room. she kept on getting colder and i could tell she was faking affection at some points. so, just a week after getting back together, i slept over at her place and she decided to break up again after a very sad night with lots of crying on both ends (specially on mine). she said ""she had to do this"", but she didn't seem confident at all in her decision. she said she had ""lost the spark"", she didn't feel ""passion"" and she couldn't ""give me what i deserve from a relationship right now"". she even said she wanted to have a chance together in the future when all this mess was behind us, and she got jealous about a girl from my class that was making moves on me lately. but she broke up. the next two days i initiated contact, one day for closure (i wanted to part in a more mature, less dramatic way) and next day to discuss some logistics and to apologize for being controlling on the seminar thing. we broke up amicably, with much love still between us, kissing till the last moment, and in a very respectful way, having decided to build ourselves separately so hopefully one day we can be together again (of course i didn't say that i would wait for her, or that i would always love her, or any of that bs). i had to text her for some unavoidable logistical reasons a week ago and she said she missed me a lot, she was struggling not to contact me and she loved me but had to force herself to wait ""enough time"" because it's ""too soon"". (i know she loves me and doesn't want to hurt me, and everytime we have seen each other it's like magnets, we are very attracted to each other). anyhow, the whatsapp conversation was quick, i said ""talk soon (kiss emoji)"" she said she wished to see me soon and ""talk soon (kiss emoji"" (but offered no concrete plans and i didn't want to be pushy or excited so i considered this breadcrumbs and the conversation was over). and that's it. up to now still in no contact (3rd week). i am hopeful that she will reach out and i will have a second shot at this to manage things in a more confident way, taking it slow and being in control. but everyday that passes by i feel more hopeless, and the grief starts to settle in. i just want to know, am i being tricked and manipulated? why is she doing this? what's wrong with her, what does she want? i want to be with her, reach out to her, but i'm hurt, and i cannot be the one to reach out. she did the dumping and she knows where to find me. should i text her to help her in case she is afraid to reach out? how long shall i wait? is there really hope, or is she already over me? maybe many of these questions can't be answered, but it already feels good to put them out there. &#x200b; tl;dr: my 22f girlfriend broke up with me (24m) after 9 beautiful months. she had doubts. then got back together three weeks later, and she broke up again after a week because after the two initial days she was confused again. she didn't feel the ""spark"", the ""passion"". it's been three weeks of (almost) strict no contact and i want to be hopeful: we have a very strong connection, we are attracted to each other and she misses me a lot. what can i expect? has anyone been through anything similar?",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.014588859416445624,0.003978779840848806,0.07758620689655173,5.0,0.0

"where to draw the line? hi everyone, i’m new to reddit but have been reading all the advice here and decided maybe it’s time i make my own post. my wife and i have been married for 6 years. the previous 2 we have been trying for a baby and been unsuccessful. as a result it has put a big strain on our marriage and there has definitely been some disconnect between us. we have acknowledged this and decided to work on things… however… wife has an online connection with someone she met on social media. she told me they’re friends, chatting about shared interests etc. but after seeing messages coming through on her unattended ipad, it appears there is a romantic element to their chats. my wife has lied about her name to this person and her marital status. i have called her out on this, especially after noticing how this same person was blocked on my social media. i hadn’t blocked them, why would i? i don’t know them. my wife admitted to going on my phone and blocking them which only made me more suspicious about the true nature of their relationship. here’s the conflicting thing. we are in the uk. this other person is not. wife spends all day messaging this person, and when confronted refuses to stop texting them. claims she is having a fake online relationship with this person for ~their benefit as this person is lonely. most of their conversations are apparently day to day chatting etc and wife assures me the romantic side isn’t overtly there. it’s almost this unspoken comfort thing between them. here’s my issue. i don’t 100% believe wife. i feel like i’ve been gaslighted about the whole thing. made to feel crazy for asking and aggressive when i push for the messaging to be toned down when all i’m trying to do is find a compromise. i have no issue with online friendships if that’s what they really are. as we agreed to work on our marriage i find it hard and disrespectful that wife continues to message this person. we agreed to spend a quiet christmas together this year and when i asked for the texting to not happen on this day i was essentially told no and made to feel that our quiet, relaxing christmas should be treated as any other day. that’s not what i thought we had agreed or what i wanted. i feel like wife has her priorities as this person >>>> me, and it’s beyond hurtful. but i love my wife and want to try and repair our marriage. i feel conflicted. do i let this messaging play out (the chance of them meeting irl is slim to none) or do i draw the line and end things now over this ridiculous fake online relationship?",advice,0,2564.0,484.0,2.0,0.004132231404958678,0.0,0.09504132231404959,3.0,0.0

(i had dated women before him and he knew me to be pansexual). we talked about it multiple times throughout the years but never really addressed it beyond that. in year 7, i got a job as a flight attendant and used it as an out. we broke up and i moved across the country and came out as a lesbian to all my new friends. i met a girl (27/f) in fa training and we’ve been dating for the past year. we even lived together for the past 6 months but now i’m moving into my own place this month. she is beautiful and kind and we have so much fun together and i’ve grown to really care about her. i’m not sure she’s someone i would want to spend the rest of my life with, but for now i look forward to seeing (and sleeping with 😉) her. i’ve been meeting her family and it’s getting more serious lately. i think she may ask me to be her girlfriend soon. i’ve still been in communication with my ex all this time though. he comes to see me on layovers sometimes and i go home to see him sometimes. i miss my relationship with him. we really had something special. he has made it clear recently that he wants to be with me again. my sex life with him is rough, though. it can feel good physically, but mentally i’m just not there. i have to close my eyes and pretend i’m having sex with a woman. i love him so much and i wish so badly i could be attracted to him like that, but i’m just not. when i have sex with her, i’m fully present. it feels amazing mentally, spiritually. like everything makes sense. but i find myself wishing sex with him feels like this. it’s getting more serious with both of them and i can’t keep living in limbo with both of them. my options: 1. choose him and delete her from my life. 2. choose her and delete him from my life. 3. delete both from my life and be really depressed and lonely. is there something i’m missing here? i am frozen with indecision. it’s an impossible decision. the truth is, i want both. but i am not poly and neither are they so i can’t have both. will an otherwise perfect relationship with him work out when sex with him feels like a chore? is this something we can live with? if i choose her and get the sex life i want, is it worth losing him? how do i stop missing him? any insight is greatly appreciated, especially from anyone in a similar situation. thank you all in advance, i’m really hurting here.",advice,0,2723.0,547.0,2.0,0.003656307129798903,0.009140767824497258,0.11882998171846434,5.0,0.0

(sometimes the occasional groan if he was about to sit down to play video games) we both have well paying jobs, he makes more money than i do. when i expressed i wanted to cut down in hours at work to work on some house projects we’ve neglected during the pandemic and prepare to continue my education he was 1000% supportive. he truly wants and supports anything that makes me happy. since the dynamic was shifting i said i would be fine if we had a 70/30 split with housework but i even prefaced- he will probably feel like he is doing more housework since on a good week he maybe does 5%. washing his own work clothes, taking the trash can to the curb, and taking the trash out when i prompt him. he needs direct instruction when it comes to household tasks. if i give him a list of tasks to do i have to write “get the kitchen cleaner from under the sink and spray and wipe off the counters” if i say “when you get a chance walk around the house and pick up trash” or “tidy around your desk” that is too broad of a task. and he won’t do it because he doesn’t know where to start. also if i say “take half an hour to fold and put away your laundry”, when the half hour is up he drops everything he is doing and walks away even if there’s only a couple pieces of laundry left to put away. i have my own relational trauma related to a past abusive relationship and having abusive parents. having to tell him what to do since he has no sense of anticipating needs causes me a lot of stress. i used to not ask and just try and do it all to avoid the panic the possibility of confrontation brings. i’ve really worked in therapy on asking for help and to make things fair. he is always open to when i express i need more help with the housework and will say he wants to help me out however he can but he wants me to be firm with him and tell him what to do. i have said how uncomfortable it makes me. like having to be so direct has even brought me to tears because it is so uncomfortable for me. but he has zero sense to anticipate needs, it may be a neurodivergent thing and also that he has never been shown - if you finish eating put your plate in the dishwasher or if you open an amazon box throw it away, don’t just leave it in the middle of the floor. he has said when i ask that he wants me to boss him around and tell him what to do because it helps him. but i get frustrated because i feel like i shouldn’t have to tell him to throw away a soda can when it is empty or put brushing his teeth on his chore list because it makes me feel more like a mom than a partner. we are planning to do some therapy together and i have also tried chore charts, asking him to set reminders on his phone, his therapist has even given him daily house hold tasks on certain days of the week but that only lasted a single week even with my encouragement and prompting. i have read the fair play method and would like him to get the audiobook or watch the documentary with me. but outside of that i don’t know what to do. i’m not wanting our home to be perfect or spotless by any means. just don’t want dishes to sit in the sink for the whole week if he says he will do them or the carpet to have a visible layer of dirt and crumbs for weeks when he says he will vacuum. i also don’t want to enable the behaviors by coming behind and end up doing all his tasks for him. has anyone had success in a similar situation? what are some things that worked for you?",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,4.0,0.004024144869215292,0.001006036217303823,0.056338028169014086,2.0,0.0

"my girlfriend cheated , should i stay. long ass story dear reddit, 26m at the time of writing & and first-time poster . i've only had 3 girlfriends in my life, and all have now cheated on me . i've been together with my current girlfriend for 5 years now shes 2 years younger than me at 24. we met in 2018 through mutual friends and became extremely close extremely fast . she started living in my house, and by my house, i mean the bedroom in my parents' house; shortly under a year of dating. everything seemed so perfect , she was studying and i was working and we spent massive amounts of time together. we never fought or had any serious problems. it felt like a fairytale. fast forward 3 years to 2021, and she's ready to start her second degree . i've been head over heels for 3 years. there's no way i'm letting her go . so i followed her to another city 3 hours away from our hometown where she could finish school . this was awesome because we could finally have our own space , and our relationship could grow . this is where things take a twist. so, while attending university, she meets a new guy friend (of course), let's say his name is moose . at first, moose seems like no trouble at all , he's friendly , nice guy , doesn't seem like the type to do anything . but we all know a man's intentions & i jokingly told her that from the beginning, but never had any real thought that she would do something like that to me . she's always been heavily against cheating and anything to do with it. weeks turned to months , and i started noticing small things, i work till 7pm most nights, so she gets home before me 90% of the time . but the odd occasion i'd beat her home i'd notice she was getting a ride home from moose & they would talk in the vehicle for what seemed like hours (probably 20-30min in reality) . nothing too suspicious, i thought, i brought it up to her, and she told me he drives her home from time to time , fair enough (let it be known we live 5 minutes from her school) . a few more weeks go by, and suddenly, she's asking me to hang out with him frequently, i.e... go over to his house , ride his motorcycle, go for a walk, blah blah blah . this is eventually what kinda fires up the pilot light of my jealousy . i start to think maybe there's something more here , or at least he's trying to make it more . i start to voice my concerns , i'm not the best. i get very quiet and resentful when i'm upset, but i eventually let her know i'm feeling some type of way about her new friendship with moose . she assures me he's just a friend , he's a nice muslim guy who wouldn't do anything like that , and that i need to trust her. i thought she was right, and i was being crazy. she's never shown any sign or red flag about being disloyal before, so i tried to move on . i don't wanna be the possesive boyfriend and stop her from having friends . so once again, i ate my emotions and tried to move forward . here we are a year and a half now with things only getting worse. she started to hide the fact that she was talking/hanging out/getting rides because i would always initiate an argument about it . i started to get extremely paranoid about what they were doing while hanging out, and frankly , why she wanted to see him so often. so, one night, we got into an argument, and she told me that over the past year of living here, she's felt like i've been emotionally unavailable and can't talk to me . she's been struggling with body dismorphia and extreme anxiety, so moose has been her vent . he has been her shoulder to cry on for almost a year . i'm lost at this moment , i've been so focused on what she's doing with moose. i completely looked over the fact that i could be the reason she wants to see him .. this hit me hard, and we had a huge discussion and aired everything out . she once again assured me she has never done anything with him and ""he's not like that."" i asked her to let me know everytime their hanging out or that he would drive her home . so, for the past 2-3 weeks, things have been smooth. i was trying to be better and supportive , putting her first . i made sure i attended to her needs and knew that i'm here for her for anything . once again, the paranoia sets in, and i have all kinds of thoughts running through my head while i'm at work . i decided to text her but get no reply for a few hours, which isn't unusual as she's normally studying. then, a short burt of messages . i reply immediately and then again a few hours go by no reply ? i start to really get into my own head here . i text her and ask if she's sleeping , and she finally replies and ""yes, she fell asleep."" at this point i'm not buying it so i decide to call her , she answered and spoke fine nothing out of the ordinary so it seemed , but i couldn't get through the day wondering what she was doing here . so i made an excuse to leave work early & sure enough, i get home and see his car parked in our apartment lot . im furious, i walk in to find him standing in our foyer and my girlfriend crying in the bathroom . i spoke with him briefly outside, and he told me it's nothing and that this situation isn't what it seems. i believed his dumbass. i went back inside to speak with her and get to the bottom of what was really happening. she's crying and can barely get the words out but tells me that he made a move on her . he put his hands down her pants and fingered here for what she said was mere seconds before she pushed him off . which i don't really buy considering the guy was here for hours . she starts acting apologetic. she really seems remorseful and feels terrible. saying she's deleting him of everything, blocking him, and cutting off all communication. at the end of the day, she still sees him at school every day and will continue to for the next 2 years . so, who's to say this will never happen again ? now, here we are , 5 years into a relationship, and i'm not sure i wanna continue . i feel so betrayed and heartbroken . now i know she didn't have sex with him or go any further than what happened , but what she did was cheating and unacceptable. especially after months of telling how i feel & how i don't like the situation going on with her and moose . i poured my heart out, and she told me i was being crazy and that she's allowed to have friends . she made me feel like i was a bad boyfriend for being so nosy and jealous .. i just don't know what to say or do. i'm at such a loss . she's begging me to forgive her and fix things. she's been crying all day and night now . i started writing this last night and have slept on the couch ever since i don't know what to do. move back to my hometown ? pack all my things and leave her? why is it so hard to do . i love her with everything i am , i gave her everything, and she let me down in the worst way . it's so hard to let her get away with this .. i want her to hurt like i do . i want her to know she's ruined and stepped on something that meant so much to me , that was our love .. i appreciate anyone who reads this. i know it's a long story that means nothing to anyone but me . but i really needed to voice myself somewhere. long story short: i moved cities for my 5 year gf , she made a new guy friend and i kept warning her about getting to close with him . after a year and a half, he finally pulled a move and got his hands down my girls pants. i'm furious but love her so much and at such a cross between leaving and staying.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.005657708628005658,0.0,0.08274398868458274,4.0,0.0

"ex bf offering to help. i'm confused. my (30f) ex bf (30m) keeps going out of his way to offer to help me. things ended 4 mo ago when he got gigs and said we're better off 'as friends'. and when that didnt work out he came back saying he missed me. i was very very cautious about taking him back (almost didnt as i have never taken anyone back before out of self-respect) and tried talking about why things ended, how to fix things and move forward, etc. for about a month things were almost normal, but i was still taking it one day at a time, and not going all in. i had a feeling he still had 'feelings' for the girl he had been seeing after the breakup. 2 weeks ago i get the 'idk what i want...' and we had a long talk that i consider as a second breakup. i basically told him to figure out what he wants and that i'm not going to do this alone, and i deserve someone who wants me. and walked away. after a week of no contact (i considered us done-done), he reached out and i was friendly. since then he's been blowing up my phone, messaging me, sending me videos/memes, and joking with me, etc. more than he ever did at the end of our relationship. and it feels like how we were when we first started dating. the confusing part is that he keeps offering to help me with little things that i mention. and its been like 3 or 4 things in the last week that he's offered to help with, without me asking for help. there's even been a few things he or i have mentioned doing together. but i dont know if he's being friendly as just a friend or if he's interested in me as a partner. we haven't made any concrete plans to meet. there hasnt been any 'i miss you' or 'i want to see you' or major flirting (only a little). and i honestly dont know how to respond. im actually back on dating apps and already had a date and have another lined up. and i've been treating my ex as just a friend and not getting my hopes up again. but based on how he's acting, i cant tell if he's acting out of guilt and trying to be friendly or if he's trying to show he's ready to be a partner. to me, guys only invest time and energy into people they are truly interested in. any advice? do i just ask him or keep doing what im doing and wait for him to clarify his intentions?",advice,0,2256.0,451.0,7.0,0.015521064301552107,0.0022172949002217295,0.082039911308204,2.0,0.0

"unsure what to do about my relationship recently, after a long series of girlfriends who didn't put in much, if any, effort into the relationship, i (24m) met someone (23f) who really cares about me and we've been going out for about 5 months. things started started well, and the only hiccup was she said 'i love you' a little soon for me. while i knew i loved her, i wasn't ready at that time to say it. i said it regardless, and it's sat a little oddly with me since but it's nothing too serious. the main issue is that we broke about two weeks ago. she's had issues with weed, was majorly depressed, and hated her job. i've taken care of a lot of my previous partners to my own detriment. for a while i supported her through this period, but it began to take a toll on me and she ultimately said she wanted to take a step back as she was feeling burnt out on life. i accepted the situation, and when we finally hung out about two weeks later, she was asleep. i wasn't upset by this, but it did solidify to me that she wasn't able to meet my needs. i asked her whether she thought she was in a good place for a relationship now, or whether this was proving to be more taxing on her when she should be focusing on herself. she admitted she wasn't in the right place for a relationship and so we broke up knowing we still cared for each other. however, she quickly realised she'd made a mistake and that she didn't want to lose the relationship. this sent alarm bells for me, as my last serious partner broke up with me saying she thought she was asexual, but then came back to tell me she lied because she was scared. unsure of how even i felt about the situation, i said we should not talk for a month and come back to see where we were at. i was fairly convinced i wouldn't want to get back together by months end, but the last day before i left we went out for a mutual friend's graduation party and it was great! we had fun, we laughed, we danced, we drank, it was everything we'd been missing. in the two weeks when we'd broken up, she'd thrown away all her weed, started exercising, gone back to regular therapy, and quit her job. she's been sober for three weeks now and i'm really happy for her. but now i'm unsure what to do when that month comes around. i've spent a long time in an unhealthy fixation on the perfect relationship and person. i know she's not perfect but she's putting the work right now, and that seems like a very important thing. i don't want to always be looking for 'better' as much as i want to be with someone who will genuinely cherish me. thoughts?",advice,0,2585.0,498.0,5.0,0.010040160642570281,0.008032128514056224,0.08433734939759036,1.0,0.0

"me (22m) and my girlfriend (21f) have amazing sex, but we only do it once or twice a month me (22m) and my girlfriend (21f) have an amazing relationship that's been going on for 2 years. prior to getting together for real, we fooled around for a while casually. for a long time, we were having sex a few times a week. it was pretty good, we got used to each other, figured out what we liked, experimented. i can't remember exactly how long ago this was, but i'm guessing around 6 months ago, the sex came to a screeching halt. now, for me, having sex a few times a week is mildly excessive, i'm okay with once or maybe twice, whatever happens. but twice in the last few months we've had stretches of 3 or 4 weeks where we won't do it. and we've even talked about it, she just said she doesn't always feel like doing it sometimes. i just don't know how that's possible, especially with how much she tells me she wants to. the one time per month we do have sex though, it's mindblowing. not just for me either, i make sure she gets everything she needs and has a great time. here's how it goes down. we'd be watching tv and she'd say, let's do it after this episode. and then the episode would finish and she'd say, can we just watch one more first? and i'd say sure, and then by the end of the episode she wouldn't be in the mood anymore. this happened a frustratingly huge amount of times. we'd be talking on the phone or facetime and she'd say, wow, i really wanna f-ck you tomorrow. i'd see her, and it wouldn't happen because she wasn't in the mood. we'd be at a party and she would pull me aside, make out with me, grab my dingaling and tell me how badly she wanted to smash. an hour later when everyone goes home she'd tell me she didn't want to anymore. it just feels unfair to constantly be strung along, to continue to be given empty promises and false hope. it's gotten to the point where i'm afraid to initiate because i know i'll get turned down 9 outta 10 times. i just go with the flow and let her decide when we're gonna do it, even if it's once a month. i've tried explaining to her that i've got needs and wants too, and i'm not asking to bang every time i see her, i just think it's part of a healthy relationship. i feel unwanted and scared to initiate anything with her because i know it'll either end up in an empty promise or a flat out no. i understand that i can't force her to have sex with me, and that's not what i want to do. i just want to feel like my needs are important too. there's never any compromise, i just feel like i have to change my ways and ignore my desires completely in order to meet her needs. what do i do?",advice,0,2652.0,515.0,1.0,0.001941747572815534,0.003883495145631068,0.07961165048543689,2.0,0.0

"caught my mum (53) cheating... with a women hi there! i have some family drama and really need your advice! sooo... the backstory: we are a family of 5: my mum (53), my dad (63), my sister (24) my brother (18) and myself (23). this story also involves a family friend of ours, lets call her b (f, 51). b and her family have been friends with my family for about 20 years and she is one of my mums best friends, a businesspartner/friend of my dads and my brothers godmother. about a month ago she was visiting my mum, when i walked into our living room and it was... weird. at the time i thought they were hugging, but they instantly stopped and talked to me and it just felt like something was off. i instantly went upstairs again and told myself that i was reading to much into it. two weeks later i had just helped my mum send something through whats-app web (old people and tech, you know how it is ;) ) when i used the computer and her phone and her messages opened and... i klicked on her messages to b (i know, a pretty shitty move, but she is normally really chill with her phone and doesn\`t mind if we kids use it or read messages to other people soooo). well, long story short: she is definitely having an affair with b, for maybe a month? i didn\`t read that far, i knew what i never wanted to know and i was busy crying. the question now is: what do i do? should i tell her i know? i have been trying stay away from her, as i can´t even look her in the eye and i don\`t like it when she touches me. though this (and my knowledge of what she has done) has hurt our relationship quite badly, as we are normally really close. should i tell my dad? i don´t think that they have an open marriage, as my dad is quite conservative (and they have been having problems for a couple of years, i kind of expected them to get a divorce at some point, as they have been talking about going into counselling. them having a ""clean"" divorce would be sad, but i could deal with that. but her cheating on my dad and not telling anyone and just carrying on like nothing happened? it sucks.). i just feel so bad that she is cheating on him an he (probably) doesn´t know. on the other hand, if i tell him, what will happen then? he will probably divorce her (?) and then it would be kind of my fault for having broken our family (i know i wasn\`t the one who betrayed anyone, but still...). i could also tell my sister, we are normally quite close, though she has moved away for her masters degree and i don\`t know if i want her to be in the same situation i am now. i feel horrible, angry at my mum, sorry for my dad and so scared that this will change everything. i know it would help me to talk to her, but i don´t want to hurt her. though at some point it is probably going to come out, when i tell her then that i knew in advance, she probably won\`t be happy with me. should i ask her if she generally would want to know stuff like that? i hope my mum will make a decision and either end her affair or her marriage on her own, as this situation (knowing but nor being able to talk to anyone) is negatively affecting my mental heath, especially with christmas and all the ""family time"" associated with it coming up. &#x200b; thank you guys for listening to my rant, i would really love any advice you have and i will try to answer as many comments as i can!",advice,0,3354.0,661.0,4.0,0.006051437216338881,0.0015128593040847202,0.11195158850226929,5.0,0.0

"i (f18) feel sad and exhausted because of my bf (m18) my bf is usually late when we make plans to see each other. he never used to be late in the beginning of our relationship but now it seems like it’s a reoccurring thing. we have always agreed on him picking me up afterschool in his car (since we don’t go to the same school) and going somewhere to spend time with each other. but nowadays he makes me wait like 20 minutes sometimes because he takes too long to get ready, or he just makes me take the train to get home so he can pick me up from there, since he lives closer to my house than my school. i don’t mind taking the train, it just kinda sucks when he keeps telling me to take it because i hate that he’s usually always late now. he is usually late because he wakes up late (like in the p.m.). his sleep schedule is not the best, and it’s not like he’s busy. he just stays up late watching stuff online and eating chips after we finish talking. i don’t have the best sleep schedule either, but i can survive without any sleep if i need to. he’s not the same, he tells me he needs at least 8 hours (sometimes he does get 8 hours tho because of how late he wakes up and he still says he needs more sleep tho so idk). a couple days ago, i told him that my school would have an early dismissal today. he said he’d wake up on time and he would be there. however, he slept late and when i called him to wake him up, he told me to take the train so he could get ready. i said i’d take the train, and he said he’d sleep for another 5 minutes. i called him several times after getting off the train, and waited around 3 hours outside in case he finally woke up (i can’t wait inside my house because my mom wouldn’t let me go out if i came in, and she doesn’t know i’m dating him either). i sent some messages too, but i got no reply. i finally went home after those 3-ish hours, and i got two texts after an hour of him saying he’s sorry. i didn’t reply because i was really sad and hurt. we usually text at night, and he texts me after he gets home (he’s usually out during the day at the gym or with his friends). the latest he’ll text me is like 1:30 a.m., but it was almost 2 a.m. and i got no text. i asked him if he was home, and got no reply. i texted him 20-30 minutes after saying that i was hoping we could at least talk that night, but he told me he was at a friend’s house watching a movie, that he might sleep over, and that we should talk in the morning instead because he’s gonna sleep late. i found it really weird because usually he’d tell me if we couldn’t talk. we text every night, and this night he didn’t tell me anything. it’s already bad enough he slept on our plans, but now this too. i don’t feel like much of a priority, and i feel pathetic because i started crying after we said goodnight, knowing that he’s prolly just watching the movie with his friends and not even thinking about me. i just feel really sad and idk what to do, i know he’s gonna smooth things over later but still, i’m so upset and it hurts because i can just tell i wanna see him more than he wants to see me, even if he’ll later say that that’s not true. he’s a great boyfriend, but he can make so much more effort with these things, and i feel pushed off to the side because of it. tldr: my boyfriend is usually late for our plans, slept on our plans today while i waited outside for him for 3 hours, didn’t bother to text me at night that we can’t talk because he’d be at a friend’s house even though we text every night. feeling unwanted and hurt",advice,0,3553.0,687.0,3.0,0.004026845637583893,-0.008053691275167786,0.10067114093959731,0.0,0.0
"my husband just admitted to me that for the first half of our relationship he was only with me for sex, now i’m not sure how to proceed with the relationship. i 20f have been dating my husband 22m since i was 16 years old. we had been gamer friends prior for about a year when he asked me in january if i would date him and i agreed. i was dealing with abuse at home and in june of 2019 i ran away from home and became homeless. we had been long distance for the most part at the time but in that june i ran to the city he was in as it’s full of resources, people i knew, and a very helpful youth homelessness system. on the bus ride up to said city he texted me and let me know he had been with another girl.. for the last year or so and that i was the other girl. while i was mad i was honestly just focusing on my survival and escaping my situation so i just didn’t care. however, 2 weeks of being in the area he came to me face to face and told me he broke up with her and he wanted to take me seriously. he had a whole speech about how he wanted to prove himself and was going to be a better person. i remember telling him that it was important to me that i don’t waste any effort since i was a homeless kid and that effort that is lost could have used elsewhere. he assured me and pushed for a second chance i decided to give it to him. in november 2020 i got a room and finally had my own bed. he was having issues with his parents and after a week of living in my room he moved in with me. that was the last time i ever had my own bed to myself. my partner unfortunately is undocumented (but is protected in the city we are in). in 2022 after struggling to afford rent on a 2 bedroom he wanted while also attending school full-time in one of the most expensive cities in the usa we came to a decision to get married so that we could file for his greencard and he could start helping me with living expenses. i can’t say that i was ready but we had been with each other for a long time. i saw a future with him, and we were really struggling. just the other day we were having a conversation about my ex boyfriend (the only other person i have ever dated) from high school who reached out to me. my husband made a comment about how he was probably only reaching out to me because he was horny. i questioned him because i was honestly confused and to where that came from. he explained how most boys and men put on a facade of “caring” when they are really trying to get in your pants. i asked him if he ever did that and he started to back peddle. i backed him into a corner in the conversation and long story short he admitted to me that he was lying to me the first half of the relationship and only wanted to get in my pants and a big part of that was because some of his buddies wanted to get in my pants as well so “dating” me handled both of those issues. i’m hurt and i told him so and he started to argue with me and tell while i was upset and cried because he said it was in the past and that he’s changed. i cut the conversation because i needed a break and asked my friend for advice. she couldn’t really give me any but told me she felt bad for having to say it but in that second year of us dating he asked her for nudes and told her i have him permission. she did not give him any but also didn’t want to say anything to me for my feelings. when i accused him he completely backed down and was a 180 from before. he apologized and told me he regretted his past mistakes and he understands if i break up with him. i don’t know what to do. on one hand his is my only support system and family. he is my partner and i love him, we have been together for so long and had lots of great experiences. we are married. on the other hand i’m sad and angry. i could have used that energy elsewhere and i can’t believe he lied for so long. when i bought myself a phone i bought him one too. when i paid my phone bill i paid his too. it didn’t matter that i was homeless i put a lot of effort in many ways. i went on birth control for him since he didn’t want to wear condoms. i sacrificed and endured a lot. but looking back at it during that time i guess he really didn’t but i’m sure being homeless was a great distraction. i’m angry i only had my own bed for a week. i don’t know what to do. we are staying at a room while i look for an apartment and the goal is to then file for his greencard. i don’t know how i feel about any of it anymore. he is different now— he has to be. he even took my last name when we married and he tattooed it on himself. he’s become a more understanding and caring person and respects that i suffer from ptsd from my time being homeless. but i also cannot believe he lied for so long and then argued and got defensive when i said it hurt me. everyone around me except for a few people are telling me to leave him. i’m not sure if i should or not and him being fully dependent on me doesn’t help. i don’t want to be a 20 year old divorcee and what if this is my last opportunity to have a partner who truly cares for me? we have had other issues, some very serious, but this is the first one that truly am questioning if i should stay. maybe if i wasn’t homeless when he lied i wouldn’t care as much. but i was and he was fully aware of that. please help, any advice is truly appreciated. i just don’t want to make the wrong choice and i’m so so scared. this is all that i know.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,5.0,0.004409171075837742,-0.0026455026455026454,0.1164021164021164,1.0,0.0
"my (18f) relationship with my family has gotten worse since my autism diagnosis i (18f), got diagnosed with autism at the beginning of this year. it wasn't really a shock to anyone, especially not to myself, but it still really affected my relationship with my family. ever since i was a kid, i had really bad depression, anxiety and eating issues. i always felt completely overwhelmed, and very alone and misunderstood. i remember being ten and being bullied by other kids because of how i acted (mostly related to stimming) and for being an antisocial bitch as i got older (to be clear, i was never mean, i just preferred to be by myself and didn't want to talk to people. if someone tried talking to me, i would do my best to listen and talk to them, but i wasn't very good at it). my own family made a lot of unhelpful comments about me, such as calling me difficult to my face, saying that i was never a good kid, saying that i'm ""lucky i'm smart and pretty because men will overlook my personality"". it was often in a joking manner, but it fucking hurt. i felt like who i was wasn't good enough, and that no matter what i did or how i acted, i was still an outsider and broken. i remember being twelve years old and crying myself to sleep because i convinced myself that i must be a psychopath because i react differently to social situations and ""wasn't very kind"" (my parents' words). as i grew older, i got a lot better at masking, to the point where you couldn't tell i was autistic unless i let down my guard. i became more well liked, especially by my family, but they always liked to remind me i wasn't naturally kind like my brother. hearing that always really hurt me, because i don't think i'm unkind, i just show it in different ways.. with masking, i felt far far worse than i did in childhood. i felt like i couldn't be myself, and like who i was is wrong and broken. i was constantly overstimulated but couldn't do anything to ease it. i ended up hurting myself really badly which landed me in an inpatient psych ward, where i was diagnosed with autism (alongside other things which were a byproduct of my childhood). since i've gotten diagnosed, things have been so much better. i don't qualify for any kind of financial aid because my family is well off, but i am finally receiving appropriate treatment. the thing that helps the most though is knowing that i'm not broken, and that i'm not actually a psychopath like i've convinced myself. i've finally allowed myself to stop masking, and life is so much easier. the only problem? my family hates it. they think that if a person is capable of acting ""normal"" then they should. they tell me off whenever i stim. they forbid me from wearing headphones in public. they make me eat foods i'm not comfortable with, and make me eat around people. they tell me that because i could do it before my hospital stay, i should still be able to do it now. they're saying that therapy is actually making me worse, and they're threatening to stop it if i don't ""improve"". my mum especially is really bad. she makes me feel like a failure. no matter what i do, it's not enough. i got a job to make her happy, but according to her it's ""not a real job"" and i'm ""not getting the first job experience"" whatever that means. she says that because i don't have relationships with classmates and co-workers that i'm never going to be a ""well rounded person"". she says that nobody likes a girl who'd rather sit by herself. she tells me that my degree and my grades mean nothing if i can't even ""act human"". i just don't know what to do anymore. i don't know how to go forward. i have never in my life felt so happy and free, but so alone and isolated from the people i love. i don't know how to make my family understand what i'm going through. i don't know if i should go back to masking, because at least then i get my family's love. any help or advice is really appreciated. tldr: got an autism diagnosis and stopped masking, my family hates it.l",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,5.0,0.0066844919786096255,0.013368983957219251,0.12433155080213903,1.0,0.0

"my (18f) girlfriend (18f) of 5 months broke up with me because she needs to work on herself. so my ex gf broke the news to me last week in a café. she said that she doesn't think its right to go on further with our relationship as she thinks her mindset is unhealthy and she needs time alone to figure out how to love herself and people properly. this all came as a surprise as i thought our relationship was good. one of the reasons she listed was that its unfair that i loved her more than she loved me. my ex came out of a relationship in february of this year, and we started talking in april. the talking stage lasted 3 months, and all the way throughout it i specifically told her to tell me if she wasn't ready to be with me as her breakup was still fresh. she said that she's ready and properly healed. i still had my doubts about that but i decided to trust her as i had a lot of feelings for her and i was falling in love with her. she asked me to be her girlfriend in july and i said yes. this was my first ever proper relationship, i felt very adored by her and she introduced to her whole family. at the same time i was scared of getting hurt as i know that she was previously very hurt from her last relationship. 2 months later she dropped that she loved me, i was so happy. i didn't tell her that i loved her before this because i was scared that it would come across as too full on and i didn't want to scare her. we hung out every weekend and facetimed every other night. so you can see how the break up came as a complete shock. we did everything together. so its so weird not being with her or not texting her to see what she's up to or making plans. i don't know how to deal with a break up. i cant just remove her from my thoughts and my life. it feels like my life has no purpose as i lost the person i love. she told me that she's deeply sorry for doing this to me and that she had no intention of hurting me. i asked her why she didn't tell me that she wasn't ready to be in a relationship and she said that she really thought she was and that she thought that she thought that she could move past her struggles and give me all the love i deserve. right now it doesn't seem like she's hurt by the breakup a whole lot though. she's acting normal on social media and hanging out with friends, and sharing it all over. whereas i cant even hangout with my friends without feeling depressed. i texted her asking if her needing to work on herself was the only reason for breaking up the relationship and she said yes. i just find it hard to come to terms with because i wanted us to work on it together and help each other, i think that it could have been possible, but she ruled that suggestion completely out. i texted her saying that i don't want any contact anymore, as us speaking would only hurt me and remind me of the relationship we had. she wanted us to be friends after it but i said that i couldn't ever be friends with her because of our past. if i have been in a relationship with someone its so difficult just being friends with that person, because i was in love with them , its never going to be the same. she messaged me saying that she needs a couple of weeks to sort her mind out, and when she's completely got over it then she said that we could get back together with my permission first , so she can show me the proper love that i deserve. do i get back with her? i don't want to be hurt again by her , my friends have already advised me against this, as they said that this has happened for a good reason and that ill find someone else. i feel like i'm incapable of giving that sort of love to someone else. but then again she hurt me very badly , but her reasons are valid , so am i allowed to be mad with her?",advice,0,3754.0,687.0,7.5,0.014725568942436412,0.012048192771084338,0.10441767068273092,2.0,0.0

"my (26m) fianceé (28f) is stuck and self-conscious when it comes to oral sex i (26m) and my fianceé (28f) have been together for 4+ years now. when we first started dating, we we went slowly when it came to being physical. as we progressed through dating it quickly became apparent i had sexual experience and she did not. i was the first guy she had been with in years. like a lot of girls she was/is self conscious about her body as well as her lack of experience. a lot of this stemmed from her prior relationship being emotionally abusive. our sex life progressed slowly, step by step, and i had no qualms with it because i knew i was trying to rewrite a history of terrible experiences at best. she wasn’t comfortable with sex at first so we just did what she was comfortable with and enjoyed being together. when she eventually was ok with sex we couldn’t physically make it work. it took us 6mo slowly progressing before we did fit together. i spent a lot of time basically pumping the brakes, insisting that she still wasn’t ready. i knew it was really important it be good for her so that sex was a good thing in her mind and not an obligation. jamming myself in was not going to do that for her. let it be noted that at this point i am totally infatuated with her, but she told me later on she put a lot of pressure on herself to “make it happen” because she was afraid of losing me. that pressure to perform is still around now i think. as our relationship progressed a few things became apparent. like a lot of girls, she requires a good bit of foreplay from a “cold start” a majority of the time even when she is in the mood. no problem, i can be helpful there and i am, with a lot of slow kissing and touching to get her where she needs to be. because she doesn’t have any experience masturbating she cannot. in fact (according to her) the only way she has ever finished is piv. this puts a lot of pressure on me to get her warmed up and ready whenever she wants to have sex. i am not too big on receiving blowjobs and handjobs. i’m happy to, but i don’t really ask for them, and would rather just have sex. like a lot of people she doesn’t have any love for giving them. she’s happy to whenever i ask, but it’s not something she enjoys, and so it’s not usually something that we flow into when trying to have sex if that makes sense. i love going down on her. this is not a new development for me and i honestly would do it every day after work if possible. i find it very stress relieving for whatever reason, as well as being a huge turn on. she loves it and usually forces me to stop so we can get to piv. she is very clean and tastes great, but she was self conscious and was not ok with me doing this at first. that is totally fine, but when we eventually did we both agreed sex was way better. she was more turned on, we weren’t trying to force it, etc. lots of girls give oral before sex, and i am happy as a clam if allowed to flip the script and give it beforehand. the problem is that she continues to be stop and go about it being ok, entirely as a self-conscious thing. she always enjoys it, but it’s the allowing me to do it bit we get stuck on. even when things are totally fine she will still cancel on me going out to eat at the last second. that’s her right. the problem is that for us to have sex i have to get her started up. if i can’t munch i have to finger her. it feels really impersonal and i hate it because i spend the whole time trying to do 3 things at once and hoping i don’t do anything wrong, because otherwise the whole thing is off. it’s stressful, and there’s a lot of pressure on me to get her to a place where she can have sex, because she can’t do any of this for herself. if i’m not doing it we will not go anywhere. i get it’s because of the relative lack of experience and not a lack of enthusiasm, and i think she is improving for what it’s worth. maybe sometime soon she will be able to get herself to the right place physically. it’s all started coming to a head recently. we’ll be agreed to have sex. as things progress i’ll offer to head south and she will stop me. i then continue touching her until we hopefully get to a point where we can have piv. the whole thing is starting to feel very robotic, and i feel like i’m putting in all the work for her to try and orgasm or even have piv. if i could just go down on her i would be able to enjoy the process of getting her there, but the other route feels like clocking in for a shift. if i don’t do my job people are visibly disappointed. today i just threw in the towel when she said no to oral and decided to pass on sex entirely instead of going through all that work and pressure. she got angry at me, but i’m at my wits end. i’m trying to be as supportive as possible, and i know you can’t just decide to be less self conscious, but it’s like a dice roll as to whether i can or can’t. if i’m going to have to provide all the foreplay i don’t think it’s a huge ask to get to enjoy it. i don’t want to strong-arm her but somehow i’m here. how do i get us to a more healthy sex life?",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,3.0,0.0028462998102466793,0.006641366223908918,0.07874762808349146,1.0,0.0

"does this woman think she's ""with"" my girlfriend? i'd like some opinions on a situation that's surfaced recently, if only to tell me that i'm reading too much into it. first some background: my gf (34f) and i (50m) met back in july, (keep your age gap comments. you'd never guess i was older than 40 if you saw me) and we hit it off right away. she generally spends a night or two per week at my house, and a couple of weekends per month. she lives an hour from me, and my place is closer to her work )normally 1.5 hr drive), so it makes sense that she comes here. we've been very transparent with our pasts, and communicate really well. i know that she's been in same sex relationships in the past, and she knows that i'm a long time widower, and a serial bachelor who's seen my share of short trusts and one-night-stands. i'm usually 3-5 years between ltrs. the situation: a few weeks ago, she told me that she was going out with friends on friday night, but she didn't know where; it was a surprise. she said she wanted to come to my place afterward, so she didn't have to drive back to her town, and back the next morning, as we had plans for saturday. no problem with me. she has a key. she told me that she'd keep me updated on their evening (she volunteered this. i didn't ask) and shoot me a text when she was on the way. i didn't hear from her, or see her that night. it was noon the following day, and she wasn't going to make it for our plans. when i asked her what happened to her coming by - the answers were so vague that i don't even remember what she said. i just remember realizing that she was actively avoiding a clear answer. i dropped it, but there was an orange flag that went up. fast forward a few weeks, and she was going through her facebook and showed me a picture of a woman, and said: ""that's who i went to the hockey game with, the night i was supposed to come to your house."" i asked about the rest of the group, because she didn't say ""one of the girls, i went with."" she said it was just the 2 of them. i picked up my phone and went back through my texts, and saw where she claimed several times that it was 4 or 5 of them. yellow flag, but nothing worth picking at. now, we come to 2 nights ago, when she came over after work and spent the night. her phone rang 4 times while she was in the shower, and then vibrated for what felt like the entire night. i get up at 4am every morning, and it was vibrating when i woke up. i told her that her phone had blown up all night and she might want to check it. yesterday afternoon we were talking during her drive home, and she mentioned the calls and texts. she said it was the gal that she went to the hockey game with. she told me the woman was drunk and belligerent, sending her shitty text messages and voicemails, sending her pictures of being outside her house, and just being (in her words) a douche. i said: ""this woman thinks you're together as a couple."" she didn't confirm or discount the theory; simply played it off as a nothing burger. so reddit, this is my thinking: the other woman took my girlfriend to dinner and hockey. she's a gay woman who by my gf's own account, has expressed interest in her before. they hang out a lot since they live in the same little town. i think that either: 1. she is reading more into their ""date"", than my gf is, or 2. there's something brewing on the side. my gf swears that she has no interest in the other woman (she's pretty large) and in gf words, definitely not her type. i can't help but have this nagging feeling in the back of my mind that the reason she didn't come by or keep me updated that night, was because things got frisky and they had themselves a tryst; gf decided it wasn't for her/was a big mistake and has been avoiding the situation by spending a lot more time with me, instead of being at home. am i reading too much into this, or did she step out? tldr: bi gf went out with a gay woman, and i think she may have cheated that night.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,2.0,0.0025906735751295338,-0.0012953367875647669,0.06994818652849741,2.0,0.0

"did i cheat on my boyfriend? 23 (f) - so here's the story last night was our company's christmas party. i stayed and had a good conversation with my office mates until about 2am. we enjoy that much with cocktails and foods. when we head out, i was the only woman who's the farthest transpo terminal, let alone destination. one of my colleagues volunteered to walk me at the station. he even carried all my stuff and the grand prize i got at the raffle. when we got at the station, to our surprise, there's no single means of transportation. we sat by the station's bench and stayed there for about an hour. it was dewy, the rain was hard and he's not getting the hang of his drunkenness. mas may tama sya sakin and even puked. i called my bff coz she knows a lot about the city. she just suggested to check-in. i thought i can't just leave him there since i was the reason he walked far from his station. so i waited for the colleague to come to his senses. when he does, i asked him gently if we can check-in and i highlighted: ""no any intentions"". he agreed with me. the nearest hotel was sogo t-t obviously, there's only one bed and the light was red. i open the door in the shower for the light and changed the room's light theme. we look like we just moved in at apartment because of our baggages. i still address him 'sir'. nothing happened naman. i put a pillow between us. i even wore my coat. we just had a long conversation about him being bullied by his superior. he was gentle naman but since he was drunk i could sense his clinginess which i avoid. i push him gently on the other side and tell him na we got boundaries. and after that, he stopped doing it. to brush off the thought na i'm with a man in a room, i always brought up my boyfriend. all my topic was dearly about my partner. how much i learned from him. na he respects and loves me. to remind myself din na i am my man's woman. malinis naman conscience ko, pero idk. i was cheated on dati sa ex ko and now i feel like i kinda tolerated some situation to happen. kahit alam ko nman to myself na i really had no choice. di ko pa nasasabi sa boyfriend ko kase he's got trust issues. what am i feeling? 😐",advice,0,2175.0,425.0,5.0,0.011764705882352941,0.0,0.1223529411764706,2.0,0.0
"i want to play video games with my boyfriend but i always get too anxious my boyfriend (19m) and i (18f) have been together for around 8 months now. we're having a wonderful time together thus far, but one thing i still find hard is playing video games with him. i'm a casual gamer and i really only like to play comfy games like minecraft or cooking mama, and some rhythm games here and there. i'm also a bit of an overachiever and a perfectionist. my boyfriend on the other hand, he's a little more of the laid-back type and he loves to play video games. he knows a lot of video games i don't, so i take great joy when he tells me all about the games he plays. naturally, he'd also want to play some of those games with me. now, the problem here is that i get terrible anxiety whenever we play some together. once, we agreed that we'd play a harder game instead of the usual minecraft we always do. he guided me through the tutorial and everything, but i think that despite his good intentions, i just kept getting more nervous. he's pretty good at this game too, to add to my anxiety. i wanted to be able to keep up with him, but i was really confused with all the movements and controls and menus that all felt really foreign to me. i was panicking when the enemies came, and i was fumbling with the controls because i wasn't used to it. he tried to coach me on how to kill the enemies, but the panic was too much and i ended up dying. the experience was so bad for me that i got anxiety poops, which i have never gotten except for situations like these. it's already happened before, so this would be the second time. i already talked about it with him, and he's really been nothing but sweet and supportive. though, i really want to get better at handling my game-related anxiety on my own, so i could hopefully surprise him? either way, i want to be able to play games with him and share in the things he loves. i'm wondering if there's anything i can do to help my anxiety? are there any games that a beginner like me can play to work towards some harder games? any advice would be appreciated. thank you! tl;dr : i want to get over my game-related anxiety of failure so i can play the games my boyfriend likes with him",advice,0,2227.0,430.0,0.0,0.0,0.004651162790697674,0.10232558139534884,3.0,0.0

"my (27m) gf (26f) regrets us having sex too early, when she has a history of sleeping on her first dates. we were just talking about the first time we had sex last year, and she told me that she felt like we shouldn’t have done it earlier (third date) since it made her feel insecure about the way i see her. she added that it didn’t feel organic as chemistry wasn’t there, and she didn’t want me to feel that she’s easy to get. this baffled me because (1) we were calling each other for hours every day prior to the first time we had sex and i felt like we were building great chemistry/connections through deep conversations, and (2) she told me stories about her sleeping on first dates in the past - especially that one fling with this doctor who was apparently really arrogant and annoying but nonetheless invited him to sleep with her after a brief lunch together because she was horny. so when asked about whether she sees sex as something more casual, she answers yes. i then ask, “if that’s the case, shouldn’t it be okay for us to have done it earlier, especially since we had established feelings/connections prior?” - she then replies she didn’t feel any of the connections that i felt during our initial meetup and daily ritual calls as an intimate vibe, and concludes with “you are a boyfriend material” excuse. this hit me hard, because when we started our relationship a year ago, she had just broken up with her ex a couple of months before and she still missed him backed then. the first few months with her were rough for me because i felt like i was being constantly compared with her ex - she would tell me how he was a better “boyfriend” and i’m a better “partner”. to her, a boyfriend is someone who can make her happy by doing romantic things, and partner is someone who can make her feel safe and secure. to be fair, i’m not much of a romantic person in a materialistic way like showering gifts and going on fancy dates, but i don’t know how i feel about this relationship not being primarily based on romantic feelings towards each other. though to her defense, her feelings have grown and matured over time. lately, i’ve been having the urge to just break up with her, since i feel like she’s simply settling with me because i’m “safe”. our conversation about our first sexual experience really didn’t make me feel better about the whole situation either. am i just being narrow minded here? really curious to hear from others’ perspective on this one.",advice,0,2479.0,464.0,4.0,0.008620689655172414,0.01293103448275862,0.08189655172413793,2.0,0.0

i need some breakup advice because i’m so sad i was in a ldr with a man i actually met on reddit in january of 2022. we met at a time where i really needed someone and he was there for me. he initiated everything and contacted me first. we talked every single day and moved to snapchat where we started calling each other as he drove home/ to work each day. he sent me flowers and gifts and we fell in love. every so often we would video call and they would last for about 6 hours at a time. he was the most kind and loving and attractive man i have ever met and us falling for each other was easy. we made a plan to meet in august of 2022 but he ended up getting a promotion at work and couldn’t take any time off for a while. we would have met sooner but neither of us had a passport and so we had to wait for months. he lives in america and so he wanted me to be with him for thanksgiving and christmas but since our plans got delayed to meet in august and he was supposed to come to me first that didn’t get to happen either. and so our new plan was april 2023. i was so excited because we were waiting to be in person to be officially boyfriend and girlfriend. i considered this man to be the one. we had talked about having a life together and who would move to who and babies etc. throughout this time of me knowing him i noticed he would lie about things and only tell me the truth once i found out (there are a lot of things he lied about and i can explain some of them if you want). i’ll fast forward a little bit but 2 days ago i found out that he never broke up with his ex like he told me he had. they have been together for almost 8 years and engaged for almost 3. on facebook i saw photos of them at a wedding in august of 2022 and she was wearing her engagement ring. i messaged her and asked and she told me they have never broken up not even for a second. they also just moved into an apartment together about 2 weeks ago. he immediately deleted every social media account he had. now i have been left absolutely devastated because i can’t believe this is real. that everything we ever had was a lie. that he had no plans to ever visit me. i can’t stop crying and it hurts so badly because i considered him the one. i want him back and i want a life with him but i can only imagine they will stay together and work things out. right now i just need comfort and advice. how do i get through this pain.

"gf has ""my way or highway"" attitude about future plans i (31yo male) am currently in a semi ldr (90 minutes apart) and now my girlfriend (29yo) wants me to move in to her own place. the compromise i would have to make here, is a three hour long commute, three times per week to my job, if i would move in to her place. my girlfriends stance on this is, if i really cared about her and loved her, i would suck it up. and i do love her, but in my opinion this is really inconsiderate of her. 9 hours of commute per week seems a lot to me and i am sure this will take a toll on me, apart from all the time wasted. i am disappointed that my partner expects this from me and does not understand how awful this is. she is also not willing to wait for me to find a job i like, located in her area. she expects me to move in q1 or else we would have to break up after 2 years. she even goes so far to suggest that we might as well break up now, in case i am unwilling to commit to this long ass commute 3x week, because it shows her that i am unwilling to compromise and apparently don't love her. i am hugely disappointed in the way my gf is responding to this situation and giving me these ultimatums while being irrational about it. it might be fair to say that i should have figured out a way to allocate to her place earlier, but she herself never openly suggested an idea to me. she only told me that after two years, we should make plans to move in together. welp, here we are now after two years but instead of figuring out a plan with my gf, i am faced with this ultimatum.",advice,0,1574.0,318.0,2.0,0.006289308176100629,0.009433962264150943,0.11006289308176101,0.0,0.0

"please help any and all advice welcome i (m) have been married to my wife (f) for quite a few years. i am hiding our ages because it would be a dead giveaway. this is a throwaway account and i would rather that my wife (and her family and friends) not be able to find this account. my wife, whom i still love despite everything listed below, is a chronic alcoholic, suffers from extreme clinical depression that in the past has included suicidal ideation, and i believe is also suffering from undiagnosed borderline personality disorder. it is quite possible there are additional comorbidities. unfortunately, after years of sobriety, my wife has again started drinking to excess, and while she is not difficult 24/7, she is frequently very controlling and has become verbally and emotionally abusive to me, particularly when she is waking up or falling asleep. i believe this is when she is the most unfiltered, and if that is accurate, then yikes. she is unable to care for herself or her elderly cat, who needs special attention to continue to thrive. i am terrified that he will be neglected or compromised or will suffer an early death if i leave the house. she adores him and would not let anything happen to him, but alcohol right now is her only best friend and i worry that she is unable to feed him or give him meds on his own. and i love the little guy too and he's been a part of our family since forever. and while i might be forced to leave her because of her abusive behavior, the cat is innocent and i really want to stay to take care of him until he passes. if i take the cat with me, any possibility of an amicable separation is over. she will come after me until the end of time if i take him with me. plus, i'd be depriving him of her company in his last years and vice versa and i cannot live with that. i cannot take the one thing she loves most away from her. as far as i know, she has no idea that i am at the end of my rope. i am trying desperately to help her, but she hasn't eaten anything for three days and is barfing on herself. i cannot take care of her in this state. she is basically an invalid and i am not physically or mentally capable of being her home health nurse. so i can't take care of her, i can't leave her, and she's abusing me. great, huh? in addition, she hasn't worked for ten years. i have supported us myself. she has been less frequently abusive when not drinking, but the abuse is still there. it is not physical abuse. with her drinking again, i have to do almost everything. she pays some of the online bills and he credit card off and that's about it. i pay for all the other bills, i do shopping, cleaning, vacuuming, garbage, feed the cat, empty kitty litter, nearly everything. 0/10 would not recommend. i must also say that when she is lucid, she is very, very sweet most of the time towards me, and i genuinely believe she is not a malevolent person. her behavior is from mental illness i think. what do i do?",advice,0,2969.0,560.0,4.0,0.007142857142857143,0.010714285714285714,0.08035714285714286,2.0,0.0

"my girlfriends financial expectations are 240k per year and i'm torn about breaking up with her earlier this year i (33m) got out of an extremely toxic relationship with a girlfriend (31f) of 11 years who abused me mentally and physically and cheated on me. we have 2 kids and she essentially abandoned them after the breakup for heroin & crack cocaine, leaving me as a single dad. &#x200b; a few months ago i got in a new relationship with a girl (23f) who seemed to tick a lot of boxes. she is absolutely drop-dead gorgeous and works as a professional model, so there is a lot of physical chemistry. she treats my kids like they are her own, despite not having any kids of her own. she is super supportive of me, says a lot of things which raise my self esteem, and has never been toxic with me. i enjoy hanging out with her and we laugh a lot together, she cooks & cleans, gets on with my friends & family, etc. &#x200b; she's also the first women i've had amazing sex with since my ex. we have sex 2-5 times per day and i can barely keep up, and she always wants to try new and exciting things like making porn together to post anonymously online, doing bdsm and other random kinks, having 3somes with other women, etc. i slept with a number of girls in-between these relationships where the sexual chemistry was disappointing. i've always been a pretty sexually adventurous guy and so a sexual connection is a very important part of a relationship for me. &#x200b; she moved in with me after a month of dating and we've been living together since. we haven't had any arguments and she is constantly telling me how much she loves me and how i'm her perfect guy, everything she's been looking for, etc. &#x200b; the one major downside is that her financial expectations are very high. before we got in a relationship she made it very clear that she expects men she dates to ""look after her"", so i consented to the situation of basically paying for her lifestyle. her last 2 ex-boyfriends were both extremely rich, and she always has a lot of rich guys chasing her through her work as a model. &#x200b; i did some accounting and the cost of dating her is around $20,000 per month (in us dollars, we live in london). she has a mortgage on a property overseas of around $6000 usd, buys designer clothing, and then there's dates at expensive restaurants and hotels, and travel. so in total it costs about $240k/yr to date her. &#x200b; i can afford this because i'm wealthy, but it's still a lot of money and actually even more than i spend on myself and my 2 kids each month combined, even after factoring in things like nannies and cleaners. &#x200b; although i love her, in the back of my mind it definitely feels like i'm in a classic ""rich guy hot girl"" gold digger relationship. she says she loves me back and her actions and behaviour are congruent with this, but there's obviously no way she would be dating me if i was poor. the financial expectations in the relationship are making me feel insecure in whether it's true love or weather i'm wrapped up in some kind of superficial fantasy and deluding myself about the strength of our connection, which leaves me feeling a little insecure. &#x200b; i've been thinking this week about maybe breaking up with her and looking for a women without these kinds of expectations, but i'm really torn because i how can i resent her for a situation where the expectations were something i consented to at the start. the kids have grown close to her and i know it would hurt them a lot to have her disappear. it would also upset me a lot and it will probably be hard to find a new woman i have the same level of chemistry with. i've never had problems finding women to date or sleep with, but it's rare to find a serious level of chemistry with women i meet as she is by far the most beautiful women i've been with in a long time. i definitely feel that if i break up with her it's going to hurt a lot. &#x200b; any advice or insights from the subreddit is greatly appreciated. thanks",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,6.0,0.008021390374331552,-0.004010695187165776,0.06417112299465241,0.0,0.0

"my boyfriend decided to pack and leave our home for the 10th time over something petty. one of his friends had a birthday party tonight at a club. him and i do not go to clubs unless it’s with each other. it’s what we both want and it has been this way since we started dating. unfortunately, my kid has been really sick this week, so i wasn’t able to make it to the party. when i mentioned i probably couldn’t go to my boyfriend last night and suggested he go alone, he was adamant about not going. he said he would never go to a club without me and that we are all a family and in this together, so if i can’t go, he won’t. today, he texted me and said his friend asked him if he was going. i asked him what he wanted to do and he said “i guess i’ll call him and say we can’t because you have your daughter”. kinda sounded like he still wanted to go, even though he told me otherwise. he came home from work and seemed really bothered by something. we laid on the bed for like 5 minutes and i asked him multiple times what was bothering him. he said he was just tired but i knew that wasn’t true. he tends to bottle things up and then blow up and spit it out during fights. he then said “well i’m going to call my friend now and tell him our kids are sick”. he called him, then hung up the phone and stuck it in his pocket and went in the living room to watch tv. this is unlike him. he always watches tv in the bedroom with me when he comes home. it was also odd that he kept his phone in his pocket because he never does that. he always leaves it out. i knew he wasn’t going to speak up about what he was feeling, so i just stood in the bedroom. i felt super disappointed though. i was off work today, so i decided to go get a haircut in the exact way he likes, i made sure to come home, style my hair and do my makeup and i even bought some lingerie to wear for him later on. i waited all day to be with him and lay next to him while he rested. when he came in the room after waking up from a nap, he noticed i was bothered by something so asked what was wrong. i explained it bothered me that he didn’t want to lay with me like he always does and that i thought it was weird he kept his phone in his pocket. he responded “oh you can’t be serious? everything bothers you! you’re so stupid! i’m done with you! all you do is complain!!!!” i follow him around the house like a pathetic girl as he’s packing asking him not to leave, feeling emotional, upset and angry all at once. he tells me i’m crazy for crying, playing the victim and yelling. he was very cold and mean. he told me he’s sick of me and doesn’t want to be with me anymore, so i walked out of the room without another word and let him leave (he was in sweats and only packed pajamas and a toothbrush so i know he didn’t go out). he always leaves to his parents during fights and he always says things like this when we fight. at this point it’s getting old. i’m 37 and want to be married. i want stability. i’m attractive, loyal, and loving. i have lots to offer. somehow, i need to be strong. somehow i need to be ok. how? i always end up feeling guilty after every fight. tonight i told him i felt abandoned by him leaving and he responded “if you were that afraid of being abandoned then maybe you’d act right”. i just want to be strong and i don’t want to feel hurt and blame myself for everything.",advice,0,3370.0,687.0,4.0,0.005681818181818182,-0.004261363636363636,0.08806818181818182,2.0,0.0
"ex moved across the country, says he regrets everything, loves me, and wants me back i started dating my ex (22m) when i (21f) had just gotten done with high school. he said he didn't want anything serious and that whatever we had was purely physical and just a fling. we both ended up catching feelings fairly quickly and i wanted to talk about it. he on the other hand, wanted to pretend that there were no feelings and that everything was going according to his plans. he was going into the military and didn't want to try and navigate the complexity of having a new relationship while being in the military. i understood but this was still extremely difficult for me. i had fallen hard. after he went into the military i wrote tons of letters, i waited for him to come home, and frankly i would've done just about anything he would've asked me to do, which he seemed to be pleased with. all the while this was happening, i was putting in significantly more effort on my end to show i cared and came to the realization that it was also unfair of him to expect me to wait around for him if he would not make a commitment to me. this man has never ever called me a girlfriend or anything. never took me on dates, we always just hung out doing whatever he wanted to do. at at his friends houses, running his errands, etc. i felt used for my body. i knew this was wrong and i deserved better but despite knowing that i still chose to be with him because i was in love with him. it hurt me a lot. it made me question my value and i cried frequently about it. he never gave me any gifts and i remember the valentines day we had spent together we went to the local diner and then went to pick up some stuff he bought off craigslist. this is just one example of many times things like this have happened. i'm not high maintenance by any means but this hurt a lot and i knew/know i deserve better. after about 9 months of him being in the military he was discharged (taken out of the military) and sent home. this was another very emotional milestone. he was feeling extremely rejected as this was his life goal while i on the other hand thought that maybe this meant that he would stop holding back and maybe decide he did want to be with me and could stop putting up this front to block his romantic feelings. things.... slightly improved. we saw each other a little more but it was all the same otherwise. hanging out with his friends, doing his chores, on his time. shortly after being discharged from the military he for unrelated reasons had to move over 1000 miles (approx 1609 km) away across the country. this put us both through extreme emotional whiplash. thoughts were ""oh, he's getting discharged, maybe he and i can be together now without his emotional reservations in the way"" to about 2 months later being like ""well nevermind he is moving across the country."" we are both young and i couldn't handle it emotionally. (keep in mind i was 18-19 through all this.) i fully understand and agknowledge that what he was going through with the rejection of the military (his dream) that he was going through extreme emotional discomfort and pain as well. all that being said, i knew this man was not good to me. throughout the duration of the relationship, friends and family kept emphasizing that this was toxic and that i shouldn't be entertaining it. offering me resourses if i needed help, etc. my answer was the same to all of them. ""this is toxic. i'm aware. i am choosing to be with him and that is that"" i know it was not wise but the head and the heart are not always in sync. he ended up moving the 1000+ miles. i remember saying at the time ""this is terrible but it is the best thing that could've happened because otherwise i would still be choosing to be with him"" it has been approx a year and a half since his big move. he is lonely where he is now. not many friends and no girls, only the blue collar guys he works with. i on the other hand, have frankly been flourishing. i am doing well in my social life, exploring other romantic avenues and have moved on. about 6 months ago (about a year after his big move) he told me that he wildly fucked up. he told me that he was hopelessly in love with me and was going to save up to move back to be with me. i can see that he has changed. i really can. i see the effort he is putting forth and that he really is sorry he took me for granted. that being said, it does not warrant me getting back together with him. i told him i will not date long distance. although this was said i still feel some unspoken pressure that he wants me to wait for him and be chaste since he made this confession to me. i have been dating and seeing other guys. i beleive he has a vague awareness of this but we don't talk about it. i've moved on emotionally and don't know how to handle this constant affection from him. despite everything, he still means a lot to me and i want him in my life even if it is not romantically. one of his friends was making the long drive across the country to go visit him over the holidays. they wanted me to tag along and go see him. i decided not to. i cannot be what he wants right now. i can't commit to someone 1000+ miles away, or someone that i was so unhappy with in the past, and he wants that commitment. i am unwilling to commit so i see that it is unwise to entertain any idea of us seeing each other right now. he now wants to fly me out to see him. i don't even fully know how to convey to him what trauma he put me through and i do not think he fully understands. he has said to me more than once ""i don't know what else you want me to do to show you i've changed."" i need advice for any and all of this. do i give him another chance? should i see him? should i move on with my other potential romantic persuits? how do i get him to understand how hard on me all of this was when he doesnt want to talk to me about it? would cutting contact be too harsh if he continues to push and not understand? help me reddit. idk how to handle this anymore. ○○○ tldr: toxic ex bf wants me back in his life after some serious reform. i am unsure how to handle the situation while causing the least amount of strife for both of us",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,6.0,0.005008347245409015,-0.0025041736227045075,0.09015025041736227,5.0,0.0

"my best friend is upset that i was a good and supportive friend. my best friend and i are 20f. we have been friends since we were 12. we used to do everything together and have weekly game nights. early in our friendship i moved 6 hours away to live with my mom. we considered ourselves sisters- her sister was my sister and her mom, my mom. during my senior year i spent several months with them during lockdown. currently in 2022 i moved an additional 700 miles away to attend college. it is a two hour plane ride from each other. now to more background. she had been dating a guy for 3 years and were friends a year before that. they got engaged in february 2021, a few days after she turned 19. i was not aware that they were a serious as they were and i asked her if we could talk about their engagement and future together. throughout there relationship i wasn’t told very much and i didn’t realize things were as serious as i should have assumed. i was excited for her! she wanted to have a husband and children- those were her goals in life. i was worried her relationship was a touch co dependent and i wanted to talk to her. a few months later, july, she finds out that she is pregnant. her fiancé comes from a very conservative family and because of this they told no one. the only people who were aware of this were her roommates, myself, and another friend of hers. i was told to keep the pregnancy a secret from her family. she was always paranoid that i would tell her family when that was never even an option in my mind. she was not interested in talking to me about her relationship. she perceived everything as an attack and was not willing to compromise. i told her i wanted to be there to support her marriage on her wedding day knowing why he was the guy for her. i was worried about her. she has been previously abused by men and i was worried she was stuck in survival mode. we used to tell everything to each other. her silence only confirmed my suspicions that something was not right. her wedding was in september 2021. myself and her other friend were joint maids of honor and we were both unhappy to be left out of the loop. we confided in each other because our friend was unreachable. her pregnancy was a nightmare- we were talking to a stranger and a shell of the girl who was there beforehand. she basically told me to get on board and i did. i was supportive, present, running errands for her. anything she needed i was. i wanted to be able to say that i stuck it out and that i was there for here. i asked if i would be included in her family photos and she told me yes only to exclude me when the moment came. her friend and i never got a dance with her. we have a lot up to be there and she never even said thank you. my long time girlfriend wasn’t even invited to the wedding. i had given up a lot to be as present as i had been the year of 2021. i lived 8 hours away and frequently drove to attend wedding events or be there to support her. she only came to see me once, she left the second her fiancé called and said that he missed her. i warned her not to drive back- the weather would be bad and would be better the next day. she decided to leave anyways and ended up having to pull over and get a hotel room. her fiancé drove to the hotel room despite her protests that it wasn’t safe and they spent the night together. i admittedly am very hurt and bitter about the year i experienced. she is upset with me that i resent her husband. she is upset that i was ever uncomfortable around her husband. she tells me our friendship is co dependent. i ask for a day to hang out with just the two of us every two months and she gets upset with me. we hang out by playing games online together. i now live a 2 hour plane ride away and i have offered to purchase tickets for her and her daughter but she says no. that her daughter cant be separated from her father for four days because he only gets to see her on nights and weekends. i offer to come stay with her and she tells me she doesn’t want that either. that because i ever disliked her husband she wont allow it. i would like to add that i have told her that i am willing to work on that relationship and the only way to do that is by interacting with him. she tells me thats the solution but then tells me she doesn’t want that to happen. i ask her what she wants me to do and she dodges the question. im at a loss as to what to do. i don’t think she trusts me anymore. i dint know what i did to deserve that. she is defensive and unwilling to communicate without arguing. i try to talk to her or ask her what she is up to and she says she likes the stuff between her other relationships to stay mire personal. im not asking for info about her other relationships btw. she has hurt me but i value our relationship. i’m not super willing to cut her off but im kind if thinking thats the next step.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,6.0,0.00625,0.0,0.09375,0.0,0.0

"is an open relationship the death of my relationship :/ i ( 22m) feel like my girlfriend (19f) and i have reached a point where our relationship has changed. we have been doing long distance now for over a year. we met online and over the last year and a half have been able to see each other 5 separate times. i live in usa and my girlfriend is living in madrid attending university there. we became “official” 6months ago and i just got back from a trip to madrid for the first 2 weeks of november. since we have always been far apart we have often talked about feeling lonely and wanting attention. my gf had brought up having an open relationship so she can go on dates and meet other people. she pretty much has been toying with the idea since she first moved to madrid in last september. she downloaded tinder and has been using it to talk to people. she didn’t actually start going on dates until after i left this last trip. she also was just meeting other girls and no guys. 3 days after i left she went out with a girl and got drunk and hooked up with her. we had talked and fantasized about a hook up but this wasn’t planned it just happened because she got drunk and decided to do that without talking to me about it. this incident didn’t bother me so much, my gf didn’t enjoy it and i wasn’t worried about her getting too involved with the girl. soon after she started looking for guys and we talked about it and i was okay with her looking for a date. she found a guy the same day lol and they went out the next weekend. she said he was nerdy and not attractive to her and could just be a good friend because they were both science nerds. anyway she starts talking to this guy everyday. me and her talk about her hooking up with him, not full sex but a blowjob. we were getting our kink on haha. well she decides to do it and goes and gets drinks and takes him home and they hook up. now of course i’m a little jealous but it was fun and new for me i wasn’t upset about it. but then she continues to talk to him everyday and she hangouts with him like every other day for the next week. nothing else sexual but she tells me they kiss and hold hands and little romantic stuff. this is when i became upset. we agreed on trying out hook ups but we also talked about not getting attached. she fights to still hangout with him after i tell her how i feel. she doesn’t care how i feel compared to wanting company and attention. she invited him over to her apartment one day while i’m alseep. i wake up and she tells me he’s been there for an hour and they’re just eating lunch and hanging out. oh i want to make it very clear that she promised me she just wanted to study. about an hour later i get a facetime from her in bed with him telling me they got horny and she wants to fuck him. i had this big flash of wanted to just break up with her in that moment but i told her that “ she could do what she wants” obviously i sound uncomfortable but i just see her face look over at the guy and smile cuz she is so excited to fuck him. she asks if i want to watch and i said yes. i realized after this moment that this whole time i’ve been over-sexualizing my gf in these hook up situations in order to cope with the fact that it makes me uncomfortable. so i start trying to focus on the sexual aspect of it. after kissing and stuff on bed before anything happens she sees my camera was turned off and asks me if everything’s okay and if i’m okay with it and i tell her she knows exactly how i feel. then she starts crying and getting upset and the whole rest of that call was awkward and painful. anyway it’s been literally a week since that haha and she went on a date yesterday with a guy. we both decided we aren’t open and she will only hangout with friends, she said she can meet people off tinder and other apps but i can’t go meet any girls lol. she hung out with this new guy yesterday for over 8hrs txted me a little during it. but she was out so late and then just texted me “ i’m home i’m exhausted” and she fell asleep i guess. it’s been over 8hrs since she sent that message. this is hard because our time zones are different and she was out super late for me so i stayed up very late. she gets so upset and mad at me when i don’t pay enough attention or make time to call her but as soon as she has something or someone to give her attention she doesn’t even think twice about me. her date went from being 5pm-8:30 or 9pm and instead she was out until past 1am. she swears she loves me and wants to keep trying but there’s been so many times when she has chosen another guys attention over me just because it was more instant or available in that moment. she’s actually kissed at least 4 people since we’ve been dating possibly 5 idk what happened last night lol. okay well that was a lot of venting i better stop now otherwise it will just keep going. i just don’t know if it’s hopeless, is my girlfriend just a cheater. like should i stop now before i continue to get hurt and feel more and more uncomfortable. fuck this really sucks, i love her a lot i don’t understand why it’s so easier for her to cheat i couldn’t meet and hook up with people so easy i would feel bad becuase i love her but it just doesn’t even matter to her. :(. i’m so fucking sad. i want a hug. i’m just sitting at work alone feeling

"i saw my friend's wife on tinder. how should i handle this? the only reason i even ask is because i don't want to start unnecessary drama in their marriage if it's an old, inactive profile. my friend got married earlier this year to a woman i know he loves with his whole heart. i think they've been together for about 7 or 8 years total at this point. they seemed happy at the wedding, and i don't really have any reason to expect things are on the rocks for them. i usually see this friend once a week and, while we haven't had any close 1 on 1 time recently, both of us have always been comfortable being open and emotionally vulnerable with one another. he has vented to me about relationship troubles with previous partners in the past, and i think he knows he could come talk to me if his marriage was in a rough patch. this man is one of my oldest friends, i love him like a brother and only want what's best for him. i'm not super close with his wife (i moved away for a few years when they had started dating), but we are friendly and i have always thought she's good for him. she's a little shy though, so i don't really think i have a complete picture of her personality. i know reddit likes to read too much into little pieces of information like this but all i'm trying to say is, while i doubt she's toxic or manipulative there is a possibility that she has that side and i've never seen it. i've been single for a little while now and regularly scroll through tinder in my down time. it seems i've aged out of the biggest tinder dating pool, so i see a lot of the same profiles come up again. tonight, i saw my friend's wife on there for the first time. her bio just had her ig handle and while there were no pictures of her with her husband, there were three with her sil (my friend's sister). my first thought was that it may just be an old profile. afaik they had some normal relationship trouble a few years ago, after she had moved with him back to our hometown but before they were engaged. maybe tinder was throwing old profiles at me to keep me using the app? my roommate told me that tinder won't show profiles if the user has been inactive for more than 7 days, but i don't know if that's true. i also wondered if maybe she was using it to make new friends! she's not from this city and is shy, as mentioned above, so she could just be trying to meet other women our age. this isn't uncommon here, but usually those profiles will clarify such intentions in a bio. i would want to protect my friend if his partner is cheating on him, so i think i should just tell him what i saw. he may know she has a tinder, he may be on board for any number of reasons. it's possible he's into some stuff i didn't know about, and i wouldn't really judge him for it if that was the case. my only concern is if it is just an old, inactive profile and my bringing it up causes conflict in their relatively new marriage when she wasn't cheating, trying to cheat, or even considering it. i'm trying to be rational and give her the benefit of the doubt, thinking of possible explanations before bringing it up with him. in the end, i think i'll ask to catch up over a beer with him this weekend and just be straight up, tell him i saw his wife's tinder and didn't know if i should be concerned. what do y'all think? btw, i don't think age is super relevant to this situation, but we are all mid/late twenties. he and i are the same age, she's a year younger. i think this detail is important only because i could see her cheating as a more likely possibility if she was 3-4 years younger; like if it was a case of her being in a serious relationship her whole adult life and feeling like she had missed out on sowing her wild oats.",advice,0,3735.0,687.0,1.0,0.0013850415512465374,0.0013850415512465374,0.07617728531855955,3.0,0.0

"bf cries every time i have an issue apologies since i’m writing this right after finishing my night shift so bear with me but i hope someone can relate. my (21f) boyfriend (23m) have been together a little over 2 years. we know virtually everything about each other and tend to not open up much to other people. he has diagnosed anxiety and (from what he and i believe to be undiagnosed ocd) for the most part you wouldn’t really notice it unless you lived with him. he’s honestly the perfect partner, he’s shown me love in the best of ways and always goes out of his way and above and beyond for me. we honestly don’t really have any issues except for this one, it sounds awful to say but sometimes i feel like he’s way too sensitive? i’m not quite sure how to put it nicely, he always puts himself down for it and he is currently in therapy, but he has a tough time opening up in his sessions so it’s hard to say what progress is there. i’m not saying this because i have any issue with him showing emotions in front of me, in fact i feel so so lucky that i’m about the only person he can open to without the need for alcohol first. what i have an issue with however, is the fact his ‘sensitivity’ made me virtually unable to share any of my emotions in front of him. i’ve recently have been having familial issues and i have brought it up to him on different occasions while i’m upset or even slightly crying. before i can even get a few words out, he’s already sniffling, and if i continue he’ll burst out into a crying fit, and i end up having to console him because he really goes all in. i’ll ask him why he’s crying so profusely and he’ll say it’s because he feels like he can’t help me, and that he’s a bad boyfriend because he can’t fix all of my problems. i understand the frustration of not being able to help your partner with everything, but when he rants to me i don’t bawl my eyes out because he had an exhausting day at work or a fight with his friend. it just ends up with me feeling a little frustrated and a little hurt, like i have to put my feelings on hold or i can’t share the full extent of my emotions with him because *half* of it ends up upsetting him to no end. i really am happy he’s so empathetic and it’s one of the things that attracted me to him but this is so very exhausting. to his credit he does recognize this as an issue, and he’ll say when it happens that he’s sorry and that he’s “making it all about himself” and that he should be consoling me. which, i mean yeah that’s all true imo, partners should be there for the other person in that moment, and be a shoulder to cry on. but i just end up telling him that it’s okay, and i just try to calm him down before he starts hyperventilating, and then sometimes he even just starts talking about what’s troubling him and i have to sit and console him through that and repress my inner problems for the next few weeks. i’ve been almost lying to him and pressing my feelings down about most things that upset me because i don’t want to upset him. i know that i could tell these things to a therapist, and i might see one in the future for more serious things but it would just be nice to be able to tell my partner the simple upsetting things without him completely breaking down about it. it’s a little weird to explain, i just really want to know how to help him, because it really hurts me because i always have shoved my emotions down as a kid to please other people and i really don’t want to do that with someone who’s supposed to be my life partner. thanks to whoever read all that, i hope it made sense.",advice,0,3598.0,687.0,1.0,0.0013568521031207597,-0.0027137042062415195,0.08412483039348712,1.0,0.0
"i (32m) just realized that i resent my wife (30f). tl;dr - wife and i have a dysfunctional sex life which led to a lot of hurt feelings on both sides. i bottled that up and stuck it deep inside me and forgot about it. it’s back now and i don’t know how to address it with her in a healthy and effective way. my wife and i have been together for about a decade, married for about half of that time. i remember that i fell for her hard when we started dating and was ready to propose to her within a year of us becoming official. we clearly took longer, for which i am now grateful, but the point is that i thought the world of this woman. and i still do. for the most part our marriage is great. we enjoy many of the same things. we laugh, we’re supportive, we regularly do both adventurous and romantic things together. i would say that for 80% of our relationship, we’re in a really great place. my wife is an incredible woman and i am very grateful for who she is and everything she has done to enrich my life. but here’s the catch, i just (as in an hour ago while filing bills) became aware that there is also a part of me that now deeply resents her. the same woman who has brought so much healing and joy into my life, has also carved out some deep cuts too. so, without further ado, let’s talk about sex. we were both deeply religious growing up and met in a church environment. because of the tension between what we wanted and what we felt we should do, we both had minor experiences fooling around with exes but neither of us had any experience with penetrative sex prior to getting married. i think we both expected it to come easy and naturally when we tied the knot. it very much didn’t. we’ve been married for years now and have never once had “piv” sex. i know that’s not the holy grail and we have both pleasured each other to plenty of orgasms in other ways. i add that only to provide some context for what follows. as sexual partners, we were very mismatched. her birth control had tanked her libido (only learned that within the last year when she went off), so she needed a lot of consistent stimuli in an emotionally connected atmosphere over time to get aroused. i grew up in an emotionally restricted family and have adhd (diagnosed in pre-pandemic in 2019); balance, consistency, and emotional connection are not my strong points. she tried to push through her lack of desire when i initiated, but any mis-step (miscommunication, wrong pressure, shifted wrong, etc.) would kill the evening. each time felt like a fresh rejection and hurt began to build up. i was not allowed to feel as a kid - and carried that into adulthood - so i wasn’t aware enough of that hurt to communicate about it. what’s more, i have always been hyper critical of myself. my dad told me a story once that he came home work one day when i was about three, saw me sitting alone in my room calling myself “stupid”. he left me alone. that was my childhood - and most of my life - in a nutshell. in the darkness of my self-ignorance, vicious criticism flourished like moss on a ruin. i wish i had known how to act then. i didn’t. that’s on me. eventually my hurt and self-anger grew too much to mask, and i began to get frustrated with her. i never insulted her, disrespected her, or even yelled at her. i did worse - i emotionally iced her out to protect myself from that hurt. the emotional connection she needed to feel safe shattered. the cycle got worse from there. she began to blame herself every time we ‘failed’ at sex. now we were both doing it. sex became not just a stressor but an outright conflict. until we started avoiding it altogether. there are a lot of other factors at play, family crises, job issues, medication side-effects. but the core of the problem is here: i just ran smack into the realization that all that hurt and pain is still nestled safe within me, thriving in a walled off garden that i locked the door to, threw away the key, and forgot about. we’ve been really trying to work on our sexual relationship. we want to have biological children, piv sex is a necessary for that. but i’ve been struggling to show up completely and just discovered that this is why. i know i need to talk to her. i want to talk to my therapist first (next session is in a week and a half). the problem is that i don’t want to walk into a conversation with her and just open that garden door up and let all that poison out. i can feel it now and it scares me. i know much of that anger is a protective mechanism against the hurt of feeling rejected by her, of feeling like she also didn’t think i was good enough. and i’ve done enough therapy to realize too that a lot of that isn’t even there because of her, just the remnants of a human being that she inherited from my parents. but i don’t know how to let her in without lashing out (to be clear, not in a violent or abusive way, but my anger or iciness towards her hurts her). i don’t want to hurt her. and i know that not addressing it will lead to further problems and the hurt that i want to avoid. i just don’t know how to. i love my wife. she wants to make things work with me, she’s willing to work on it. most of me wants to make things work with her, and i’m willing to work on it. i’ve been in therapy and have gotten much more emotionally connected and aware. our communication has improved, my adhd is treated now (which has helped but it’s a temporary support not a permanent cure), and i’ve helped her to feel emotionally safe with me again. i’m just bone deep afraid of getting pushed back into that dark place and i don’t know what to do about that. i guess what i’m hoping for is guidance from someone who has been here before. i’m not coming into this as a saint. i know my damage is responsible for much (if not most) of this. i know she wasn’t perfect either. i’m not interested in divorce, non-monogamy (cheating or open relationships), or anything separate from making us whole. i just want some help on getting this poison out of me so we can keep moving towards the marriage we’d like to have together. thanks.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,3.0,0.0025167785234899327,-0.003355704697986577,0.10067114093959731,0.0,0.0
"should i reach out after i was ghosted almost a year ago? title is pretty self explanatory but for further context: i (27nb) dated someone (27nb) for about three months earlier this year. things seemed to be going really well, they said and did things that led me to believe the feelings i had for them were mutual, and then they seemed to abruptly lose interest. we went from texting very consistently throughout the day and making regular plans to see each other, to them rarely responding to my texts more than once and never mentioning hanging out again. this went on for a couple of weeks, they acknowledged their behavior was weird but offered no explanation or did anything to change it. eventually i broke things off because i didn't think they would do so otherwise, rather that they would just never speak to me again and the breakup would be implied, and ending things outright seemed better than that. i hoped they would offer some further explanation but they didn't. they never really spoke to me again again except to match with me on tinder once about six months ago but then tell me they only wanted to be friends, followed by more radio silence until i remade my social media accounts and they never followed me again. i know that seems pretty cut and dry- they aren't interested and that's fine, i'm in a happy relationship now and i know their behavior says more about them than me- but i genuinely cannot stop thinking about what went wrong. if i did something wrong, or if they just realized they didn't like me as much as they thought they did...it bothers me to the point of feeling very upset or losing sleep. i would like to ask them in a straightforward way for a genuine explanation, but i know i'll probably come off as pathetic or crazy. i just want to stop thinking about it so i can focus on the person who actually likes me and be present with them. tl;dr: someone ghosted me after three months of dating, matched me on tinder to ""be friends"" only to immediately ghost again, the whole thing has really messed with me and i would like to figure out what i did wrong or what their deal is but i don't want to seem pitiful and weird.",advice,0,2164.0,399.0,3.0,0.007518796992481203,0.002506265664160401,0.08771929824561403,1.0,0.0

"i think i fell in love with my cousin’s best friend and it was the best but at the same time the worst thing that’s ever happened to me a little over a year ago i (22f) went on a holiday weekend with my cousin (40m) and his best friend (40m). at that time i was in a 2 year long relationship with my boyfriend (23m) but we had a lot of problems and were thinking of breaking up. tbh when i went on that trip i was taking times to think if it will be better if we went on our separate ways. long story short, me, my cousin and let’s call him david, had a great time, but i couldn’t help but notice, david was kind of flirting with me. i thought nothing of it, cause i knew him since i was a kid (literally)and he always was that ,,hot irresistible sexy player” type. i caught myself being kinda interested in him, but i knew it was wrong, since i have a boyfriend and he was my cousin bff. when we came back home from our trip me and my bf broke up, because of a lot of things, but firstly, i know it’s not right to think about someone else, while in a relationship. i ended up texting david and after chatting for a few days he asked me out. we had a beautiful walk in the mountain and watched the sunset together. we did end up having sex and when i tell you - it was amazing. i mean, he’s experienced lol. me and david continued seeing each other in secret for a couple of months, but every time i saw him i felt something more and more… he was always so caring, gentle, thoughtful. he always asked about my day, my week and we really talked about it. i shared him my biggest secrets and he was so supportive. he was the only person i could talk to about certain things. he was always nice, never got in a single fight with me, we just talked our conflicts out, it felt like magic. time passed by, but me and david weren’t official and i don’t think we were ever gonna be. it was a secret that couldn’t be exposed mainly because of the conflicts it was gonna cause in my family. after some time me and my first bf got back together because i had attachment issues (we lived together our whole relationship) and i thought i couldn’t be alone. but before i got back in a relationship, me and david exchanged b-day gifts. each one of us wrote the other a letter to read on the birthday. when i read mine i bursted into tears, cause it was the most genuine and wholesome thing someone has ever wrote for me. when david’s bday came he texted me how thankful he is and how amazing i am and i couldn’t stop smiling the whole day. me and my bf still don’t get along, we live together, but we fight over everything, he tells me i’m useless, that i should listen to him and do everything he says and that sometimes i deserve to be beaten up. please believe me i tried everything to fix that relationship and now i’m desperate. turns out my cousin knew about me and david the whole time, cause david didn’t want to lie to his best friend. my cousin told me that he was mad at first, but then he saw that we were enjoying ourselves and accepted it. my cousin says he thinks me and david are in love, he says he hasn’t seen him to things like that and talk like that for any other woman and they know themselves since kindergarten. my cousin has forbidden the contact between us as long as i’m in a relationship. everyday i think about texting david, everything reminds me of him, i check his socials every day, i can’t get him out of my mind. idk what i should do. should i leave my relationship? should i try harder? should i contact david? i’m confused.",advice,0,3545.0,687.0,4.0,0.0056022408963585435,0.0056022408963585435,0.1400560224089636,3.0,0.0
"how can i prove to my friend that her boyfriend is no good? my bff and i have been friends since we were 13 (now 29). about six years ago she met her bf (27) and they have 3 kids together. she struggled a lot with post natal depression after her third baby, so i spent a lot of time at their place because i lived close and i was working from home at the time so my days were pretty open. as a teacher, he would be gone all day so i didn’t spend much time with him as i would leave when he got home. fast forward about six months and my friend was hospitalized for a few days so she asked if i would help her bf out at home with the kids. me and his mom did a lot of it between us as well as the bf so i was spending a lot of time at their place. i guess you can guess where this is going. one night after i’d helped him get the kids fed and to bed, he offered to order a takeaway and we sat and ate it over a few beers. quite quickly he started saying he couldn’t understand why i’m single and that he wishes his gf was more like me etc. i was super uncomfortable so i stood up to wash up the dishes and he also stood up, turned my body around and started to kiss me. i instantly moved away, asked him what the f he was doing, and left. that night, sent me a string of messages calling me frigid and a prick tease etc. i continued to help his mom with the kids while he was working until my friend returned home about a week later. she was pretty unwell so i didn’t want to add to her stress, so i just avoided any contact with him and acted as though nothing had happened in front of her. he was being a total dick to me though. mocking me and acting super cocky to the point that my friend started to notice and told me to just ignore him. as my friend began to get better, a mutual friend of ours advised me to tell her. she (the mutual friend) told me that her coworker had said he’d also hit on her in a bar and been aggressive when she turned him down. hearing this, i knew i had to tell her so one afternoon when he was at work and the kids were with her mil, i told her what what happened. she was pretty quiet at first and looked embarrassed but not shocked. then as we talked she said that i must have misunderstood his intentions and said it’s best if i don’t come to the house for a while. that was about three weeks ago and since then she’s been cold in texts and i haven’t heard from her. he messaged calling me all kinds of things including a home-wrecker and a terrible friend until i blocked him. i’m totally lost about what to do. i’m angry with my friend for taking his side but i’ve also seen how aggressive and controlling he can be so i’m concerned that she is being emotionally manipulated and abused. plus they have three children and she has no family and i know she worries that he would get the lion’s share of custody if they ever separated. i think if she had proof of his cheating it would help her to admit it to herself as well as help her in any future custody battles. i contacted a few women on instagram to ask them to contact him to see if he’d respond but none of them were willing to do it. but beyond that i don’t have any ideas. how can i get my friend to see that i’m not the enemy?",advice,0,3225.0,674.0,7.0,0.010385756676557863,0.0,0.08902077151335312,2.0,0.0

"my (18m) ex (18f) has a boyfriend but i think she still loves me. as much as i don’t like going to reddit for advice for obvious reasons, im at wits end with my situation. me (18m) and my ex (18f) broke up in june after a two year on-and-off relationship. for the entirety of our relationship, i was always afraid of being heartbroken again like with a previous partner of mine, so i was always distant and sometimes hurt her feelings so as to push her away to make our seemingly inevitable breakup less painful for us both. she was very committed and loved me through every second of it. she was the ideal partner and i can’t see myself with anyone else in my future. when we broke up, she almost immediately began dating a former friend of mine and she claims to be much happier without me despite her showing signs depicting otherwise. where i used to cater to every physical or financial need she had, i was always reluctant to show physical affection for fear of growing attached to her. her new guy is almost the polar opposite. he shows no concern for her physical health despite his catering to her emotional needs. she’s gained a bit of weight as a result of her birth control and her new eating, drinking, and smoking addictions, and she’s drowning financially living with her friend’s family. she, at first, decided to block me out of respect for her boyfriend, but has since unblocked me and even added me back on snapchat after some months of unadding me. whatever small talk we make usually results in her being withdrawn, cold, and distant. i like to believe this is out of fear of her own feelings for me because she can always get rid of me. she wears sweatpants i left at her house even after returning most of my things, asked about me frequently to a mutual friend (especially while intoxicated), asked if he could bring her some of her favorite foods i used to make for her, and even hinted that she’s not sexually satisfied with him like she was with me. she got mad at our friend and unadded him after he called her new boyfriend out for being uncaring and essentially a deadbeat. it’s been 6 months and every day without her gets harder and harder. i do everything i can to make myself better so i can someday show her how much i’ve changed. i signed up for welding school, i have a good job, my truck is paid off, i work out, and even eat well. i don’t play video games anymore and try to maximize my productive time. i don’t want to move on. she’s perfect and i can’t imagine life with anyone else. i want her back. what do i do? thanks.",advice,0,2563.0,492.0,7.5,0.016260162601626018,0.0040650406504065045,0.09959349593495935,1.0,0.0

"my bfs dad is toxic so me and my bf have known eachother and been with eachother on and off for nearly 10 years. reason i say on and off is because his dad has gotten inbetween us and forced my bf away from me multiple times. i was brought up with 2 parents siblings watching my dad and my mum working their butts off to provide for us. when i met my bf i was 14 in school and i feel for him, his personality, his smile nothing could compare to him. the only problem he had was a hygiene problem, hed get bullied badly for it by i saw passed all of it for who he was. when i went over to his house i started to realise why, his dad did not bath, shower, wash at all, and hes one of those who always thinks hes right and his excuse is “it washes the oils off your body”, baring in mind this guy has gone weeks, months without washing. so my bf being brought up by him since he was 7 cos his mum walked out on them has obviously took those habits from his father. i was/am hopeless in love with my bf, i started to teach him how to wash, how often he should be washing, i even watched barber tutorials so i could cut his hair for him. his dad has bipolar and hes also a massive narcissist and he used to beat my bfs mum as to why she left dont blame her. he shouted at me and my bf for hugging infront of him because it “offended him”. he also cusses women in general, bit of a mysoginist too. so you could imagine the way poor 14-17 yr old me was treated, even mocked calling me a s- for having instagram when i was 16. at 17 me and my bf split because me and his dad fought pretty badly because i was angry at how much he neglected my bf and he only gave a damn about his online gfs. and how ive had to teach him how to wash himself, his clothes, cut his hair and try and focus on his grades and his school work because his dad was depressing him with his moaning at my bf about how he cant afford to provide for him, and telling him to f off and move out with me asap. at 16 years old. because the lazy c word of his dad wont get a job because he thinks hes hacking life by scrimping and scrapping. barely providing for his kids, 2 boys, cos my bf has a brother whos younger, who his dad has always favoured because he acts more like his dad and we all know he loves himself. they had social services out and told him my bf was underweight and how his brother was noticably bigger. all because his dad was jealous of my bf for having me in his life. you can start to understand why i hate his dad. and at times his mum for leaving. so skip to present day we got back together somehow and i played nice with his dad, for my bfs sake. im 21 my bf is 22 im working a full time job whereas my bf is not working. again a week before christmas his dad has gave my bf the same ultimatum “leave her or your out of the house”. the funniest part about it is again this was over who gave more of a shit about my bfs wellbeing. as his dad had a go again at me for me trying to get my bf a job. and he wants my bf to be like him scrounging off the system and barely surviving. my bf is fully capable of work, he has worked before but his dad dragged him backwards yet again. me and my bf are secretly texting behind his dads back so he doesnt kick him out. my bf has a job interview tuesday and we are going to work on him getting out of that house. away from him. ive never hated a human being more than his dad. i hope he rots, currently plotting my revenge for when me n bf move in together.",advice,0,3482.0,687.0,4.0,0.005625879043600563,0.0,0.08720112517580872,0.0,0.0

"where did things go wrong? last weekend i (22f) met a guy (22m) at a social gathering. i’ve been working on intentionally building a community and making new friends as i’ve just moved to the city. i approached him and we really hit it off. we had a lot in common, and learned that we shared similar cultural backgrounds. he was even surprised to see how much i could read him and accurately guess his interests/hobbies, work, etc. overall it was a great convo and we exchanged socials. reminiscing over our interaction i realized that he was an attractive guy and our convo was slightly flirtatious, but i’d prefer to just be friends first and see where things go. right now i’m prioritizing making new friends, and build on each connection. after figuring out my intentions and sticking to them i reached out the next day and asked him if he’d be open to getting food at a place he recommended in our initial conversation. i sent him my number, he texted asking when i was free, and we nailed down a time and date. unfortunately, a few hours later he messaged me saying “hey, sorry i’m not looking to date right now.” and then blocked my number. i was honestly shocked and confused, but decided to sleep on it just to figure out where things went wrong. the next day i reached out over social media letting him know how confused i was and blindsided i felt about his message, as well as explaining my intentions and apologizing for any miscommunication. he read the message hours ago and i’m still left with so many questions. where did things go wrong?",advice,0,1555.0,289.0,1.0,0.0034602076124567475,0.0,0.10380622837370242,2.0,0.0

"boyfriend is terrified of sex throwaway for privacy. my old best friend turned boyfriend(21m) and i(20f) have been dating for around 6 months and the relationship is absolutely wonderful. we have amazing chemistry and nearly every aspect of the relationship is perfect. we have even talked (very informally, and obviously way down the line) about marriage and kids. the only issue is sex. my boyfriend is terrified of penetrative sex. we do nearly everything else in the bedroom and overall i am pretty satisfied but i think having sex would take it a step further and it’s something i want to do with him. we’ve talked about it once before and he said that when he did it with his last girlfriend he had some pain so i guess that is the cause of his anxiety. we tried having penetrative sex once and as soon as we tried to start he immediately got “out of the mood” if you know what i mean. i’ll start by saying i never want to do anything he isn’t comfortable with and i never want to pressure him into anything. but at this point i’m starting to get frustrated. i truly mean it when i say that i would be perfectly okay with it if we never have penetrative sex, and i’ve told him this. but whenever we do things in the bedroom he always hints or outright says that we’re going to have sex and we never do, which is the biggest part of my issue. also like i’ve mentioned he’s talked about having kids down the line. i know deep down that it’s probably irrational, but a part of me is beginning to think that he’s scared of or doesn’t want to have sex with me. so, i guess my question is how can i support him in our sex life and make him feel comfortable while also making sure we are both totally satisfied in the bedroom? thank you",advice,0,1735.0,341.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10557184750733138,1.0,0.0

"am i crazy? was i manipulated? 20 yr female. need help and input. please! hi everyone, a month ago i went through the most horrific breakup ever. i don’t even know if i’d call it a breakup but rather a straight up abandonment. and i can’t help but overthink the situation, but as each day passes i am slowly realizing i was potentially manipulated. context: when we first started talking things were great, a little too great (suspected love bombing). he was so verbally and physically affectionate, excessively now that i look back. immediately saying things like “i can’t imagine my life without you”, mentioning marriage and making plans for the future. two weeks in he asked me to meet his parents, i set my boundary that this was too soon. the weekend they came to visit he texted me saying “my dad really wants to meet you” and guilt tripping me. of course, i cracked. then, he proceeded to say i love you around the same time. i knew it was way too soon, but i said it back because i didn’t want to hurt him. the first time we had drunk s*x (i was sober) i set the boundary i didn’t want to do any backdoor stuff if you know what i mean. it seemed like he lost control, and he tried to eitherway. when i expressed discomfort with it, he started sobbing saying extreme things like “i need to go to rehab i’m a terrible person” and slamming walls in my bathroom. i felt guilt and forgave him. about two weeks after this, i tried to play a small stupid prank on him and he slightly pushed my chest. after i laid in his bed sobbing from shock and confusion, he laid next to me hugging me and saying “i’m sorry i blackout when i’m angry” and claimed he didn’t remember pushing me. he then went to shower and said “i hope you’re still here when i come back out” because he knew i was contemplating leaving. i stayed because the thought of how he would feel coming out of the bathroom and seeing an empty bed hurt my heart. as time progressed there were moments he would snap at me out of no where for seemingly no reason. like super angry in the flip of a switch. even when i was just trying to help. he then apologized and said he “does this all the time” and he’s “working on it”. whenever he did something that made me uncomfortable and i confronted it, he would break down and sob. i’m talking like meltdown. all of a sudden overtime i noticed he like started getting distant out of no where. less compliments. less physical touch. less everything. his face got really cold if that makes sense. just like emotionless. about a week before he broke up with me he stopped texting me. making me feel crazy for wanting to know what he was thinking. he told me he needed a night alone to think of how he can “be a better partner for me”. he kept extending these nights, with no reasoning just leaving me confused. he said i “wasn’t respecting his boundary for space” when in reality all i wanted was clarification to settle my anxiety. i stayed up for 48 hours at one point from anxiety over not knowing what was going on. a few days before the breakup, we were having an argument and i asked to step away alone for a second to catch my breath and clear my head before responding. i went into my bathroom. he came busting in 4 times, pushing me and pushing me despite me sobbing. i kept begging for space and he continued to berate me. i snapped and i said “i’m done with your shit”. he was like “wow i cannot believe you said that to me” and began to attack on me for that. i said “that’s reactive gaslighting and you’re gaslighting me”. he looks me dead in the face and says “no you’re gaslighting me.” was i??? i was just so hurt. i told him to leave my room that night. few days later, he says “i’m going to come to your room so we can talk”. he kept postponing the time, almost to deliberately hurt me. when he finally comes to my room, he says we’re done. starts packing up all his stuff. he goes “don’t block me from leaving”, as if i would ever do that. treating me like i’m crazy. i was begging him to stay. he looks at me and says “go get the help that you so badly need”. but before that he said “you’re the love of my life” while packing his things up. as he left my room i said “i love you”. he says “i can’t say the same” and walks off. he texted me the day before saying i love you. like how can you not love someone anymore that easily? i texted him right after he left “i love you and this relationship, and this is worth working for and saving”. he responds “i loved you and i loved our relationship.” and then proceeds to block me on everything. literally everything. less than 48 hours later he texts my roommate and says “i still love her. is she okay? i know i shouldn’t care but it hurts to know what she’s going through”. and you told me you didn’t love me less than 48 hours before? a few days before he ended things he told me he could see himself having kids with me. he made me feel crazy while breaking up with me like i was some psychotic person. i can’t help but wonder if i was in the wrong. yes there were moments where i was too anxious and that displayed in my actions. but i never had any bad intentions. i just needed reassurance. i blocked him incase he reaches out. i am closer with my friends again and weirdly enough i am talking more than i did when i was with him and being more like my normal extroverted self. has anyone had similar experiences? how can someone go from supposedly loving you to leaving you in the worst way imaginable? especially after i had opened up about my fear of abandonment due to my childhood trauma? about a week and a half ish before our breakup he woke me up at night because he had a nightmare i completely ghosted him and blocked him on everything, and he told me it was horrible to dream about. so how could someone possibly do that to me and put me through their “nightmare”? someone please give me your help and opinions. i haven’t opened up completely to anyone about this. but i feel like i may have been manipulated. somehow, i still feel crazy.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.015280135823429542,0.005942275042444821,0.1273344651952462,5.0,0.0

"my ex-fiance canceled our wedding the day before i (21f) was practically dumped at the alter when i was 18. my ex-fiance (then 20m) has a very controlling and possessive mother. his family at first welcomed me with open arms and accepted me like a daughter. i would take his younger sister do do things just her and me. i would spend christmas eve with them. they even had me house sit for then one time. it seemed like everything was going great. but i was his first girlfriend. and he was their first boy. they were a very religious family and had stereotyping gender roles. at the time i was also religious and was okay with the gender role of staying home and raising kids. i know better now, but i was young and naive then. but about a year into the relationship, i began having problems with their family. we would argue a lot. they would verbally harass me and say i was trying to take my ex away from them. they said the lied about ever loving me and said i would never be accepted into the family. my ex would just sit there and never defended me once. i avoided them like the plague until we got engaged. then we went to them to announce our engagement. they said we were stupid and that it would never work out. we argued a lot. his sister made up some stupid shit about me bullying her which i never did. i loved her like a sister. it ended with me storming out crying. i begged my ex to never let me go through that again. i never spoke to them again. the wedding planning begins. my family started paying for stuff and we planned the wedding for 5 months after we got engaged, august 1st, 2020. but the day before rolls around. i couldn't get ahold of my ex. i tried calling and calling but he wouldn't answer. we had to go get his tux and set up the rehearsal dinner. i call my mom and start heading to her house. i lived on my own at that point. she went to his house and he told my mom first that the wedding was off. that he didn't want to lose his family and that they never approved of me. so pretty much he canceled our wedding the day before because mommy said no. she called me and told me the bad news. i had to hear it from my mom first, not even him. he and i eventually talked, but it was a total screaming match. we broke up and he over time payed my mom back for the wedding. he later on told the internet that i was the abusive one and that i wouldn't stop harassing him, which was a lie. i said one mean thing on a google docs we shared and it was about his friend that later on drugged and raped me. not him. fast forward to dec 2022. i'm with a wonderful man. we are living together and already planning our future. his family genuinely loves me and wants us to get married. i had massive anxiety going into new relationships about in-laws because of my exs family. i for months was scared that they would hate me too. but not all family's are like my exs. i'm even going to my bfs nieces ballet recital tomorrow. i still have trauma over this whole experience. it was one of the worst days of my life. i'm over him now and am madly in love with my bf. just beware of mama's boys.",advice,0,3113.0,610.0,7.5,0.014754098360655738,0.004918032786885246,0.12622950819672132,0.0,0.0

"how do i communicate so my wife understands? just a little disclaimer, i have real issues with verbal communication which means i avoid talking about my feelings at all costs. anywhere in the incredibly long post below (sorry) where i’ve verbalised my feelings to my wife, has made me feel very vulnerable and is not something i would typically do. which is why i’m seeking advice, i’m obviously doing something wrong! i’ve been with my wife for 10 years, married for a year and a half. i’m not going to pretend that at the beginning everything was great, because we’ve always had issues around sex. just as a little background (it’ll be relevant later, i swear). i don’t think it’s uncommon to have a different sex drive than your partner - which is where our sex issue lies. i find that i initiate 99% of the time, and probably get rejected 80%. i know she has body image issues and i’ve tried to be supportive, she’s not comfortable being naked and i’ve never pressured her to take off her clothes. i’ve tried to make her feel more confident by getting her little sexy dresses that cover the areas she’s self conscious about. but the sex never really evolves naturally i.e., there’s never a mutual want for it, and when we do have sex i find its me putting in 90% of the foreplay. as much as i want sex, i want to have it with someone that actually wants it. recently, the worry that she doesn’t want it and is just agreeing to it has been i pretty big block in my head and i haven’t been able to finish, which tbf probably makes her feel less sexy. but throughout our relationship the constant rejection has really effected my self esteem, to the point where i’m convinced she doesn’t find me attractive (also might play a roll in my below paranoia). recently, a new issue has arisen where i’m finding her to not only be sexually distant but also emotionally. she has made some new friends, the first friends she’s made that she hasn’t met through me. that sounds controlling, but it’s not - she moved to my area and my friends became her friends. i don’t have an issue with her having new friends, but she has started spending every free second of her day talking to one of them. ok, that’s an exaggeration, but she does text/video call with him all the time. i’ve spoken to her about it and tried to be honest with how it’s making me a touch uncomfortable. i’ll get in from work and she’ll be on the pc gaming with him and that’s where she’ll stay all night until she comes to bed, often that’s not till 3-4 am. she doesn’t stop playing to come eat dinner with me, so i end up feeling pretty lonely every night. i’ve just started a new job and other than a “how was your day” she’s shown no interest in how it’s going. another layer of secrecy is that she doesn’t text him, she snapchats him which could be completely innocent, but i find it a little disconcerting. this week things have been very tense because i’ve explained to her how i feel and the overarching response i get is that she doesn’t care. she hasn’t changed the way she’s acting at all and i’m just totally defeated by the situation. i had a little melt down on wednesday. she was gaming, so i was texting her about how i’m feeling in the relationship (i find written communication easier as i can think about what i’m saying and if the words i’m choosing are right or not), and i can hear her in the other room laughing with her friends. i’m sure she wasn’t laughing about me, but i ended up feeling pretty hurt and like she didn’t really care about how upset i am and that our relationship isn’t very important to her. to add to this, a couple of months ago i found a vibrator on top of her pc and it sewed a little seed of paranoia in my head (i told you the sex theme would return). we recently had people stay over and she tied it away. now i’ve just found it reappear in the same spot. given our recent interactions, i don’t think it’s something i can speak to her about. i know i’ll just be accused of not trusting her, but with the whole picture, i’m fairly confident the majority of people would have the same questions running through their head. as much as i’m hurt about everything that’s unfolded this week, i don’t think i’m ready to completely give up. i must admit, i did ask her if she wanted a divorce during my mini-meltdown, because i don’t think she’s taking the situation seriously (and still don’t). for me, if she was coming to me saying she was unhappy in the relationship my priority would be to understand and make steps to address the issues and hopefully work towards a stronger relationship. but is this a case of everyones different, or does she genuinely not care? all i’m asking for is a little reassurance and attention from her. i’m struggling to get her to realise this. i’ve outright told her the situation with this guy is playing on my insecurities, but that’s not what she hears. her take home message is that i don’t want her to be friends with him and it devolves into an argument. she’s not really listening and i don’t want to have another argument about it. but every time i try to explain, nothing changes and next week i’ll feel the same way. can anyone give me any insights or advice?

"how should i interpret tldr gf bailed on holiday plans, twice my girlfriend (29) and me (28) have been dating for almost a year. for the most part it has been great but recently we have been arguing more. i moved to city x for work and we met. her family is all in city x and mine live in another state. things were getting serious and i am going back home for the holidays for 1 week. i invited her to come with me. some context she’s the first girl that i’ve ever taken back home for holidays and it’s a sign i want to be more serious. initially she was ecstatic to go so i bought a plane ticket for both of us and she approved. she then said no my family wants me to travel to our home country to see relatives. so i cancelled the plane ticket (this one had free refund). about a month later she says that the flight to home country wad too expensive and really wants to spend holidays with me. so i work to cancel my flight w refund so that we can get a flight together sitting next to one another. today she tells me that she changed her mind and wants to go to home country. we get in a pretty sizable argument because she initially said “i don’t want to be around you with your family because you act differently around me.” primarily bc i am a little more quiet, less touchy and a little more awkward since i don’t like being touchy around family. i got offended but said i’ll work on it then she changes the story to see oh i meant i want to go back because my relatives back home really want me to come. so i canceled the flight and only got about half refunded. how should i interpret? is this a red flag?",advice,0,1616.0,324.0,1.0,0.0030864197530864196,0.0,0.1111111111111111,2.0,0.0
boyfriend has ed this is so hard to discuss but i really need help. my boyfriend just recently began battling erectile dysfunction. we are both young (early 20s) and the ed is due to a preexisting health condition of his. i really feel selfish saying it’s taking a toll on me because i know it’s his body and also taking a toll on him but i’m really not sure how to navigate this new lifestyle. we always prided ourselves on being very sexually compatible and had amazing sex. it is the complete opposite now. i feel like i can’t pleasure him. he still pleasures me and i love it but i wish i could reciprocate. i also can’t sit here and lie and say the ed isn’t taking it’s toll on me. i’ve found myself seeking more validation and feeling like i’m not good enough. i try to remind myself it’s not a reflection of his attraction to me and rather just a bodily response to an illness of his but it’s hard. i want to feel attractive and i really do miss our sex life that brought us together. our relationship has been severely suffering. we argue constantly over small things. he says i’m so validation hungry and oftentimes accuses me of seeking validation from others or accuses me of wanting to cheat (he’s looked through my phone and i’ve done neither and don’t plan to). i don’t know how to talk to him about how i’m feeling and our relationship without sounding selfish or not understanding. he gets extremely defensive and thinks i’m being unreasonable or not empathetic. i’m lost on how to move forward with the relationship in a healthy way. i don’t want him feeling so insecure that i’ll cheat or seek validation elsewhere. i don’t want to mourn our sex life. i know this may sound dramatic but we’ve been having sex since 14 and it literally went from 100 to 0. i also want to help him emotionally to get through this. he suffers with chronic illness so this new diagnosis has got him in a bad mental state. any advice helps. please try not to be too judgmental.,advice,0,1973.0,385.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11168831168831168,0.0,0.0

"i think i'm falling for my boyfriend's best friend i (18f) have recently been getting a little too close to my boyfriend's (18m) best friend (18m). i know this sounds very cliché, like it's straight out of a fanfiction plot, but i need advice and there's no one irl that i feel that i can talk to about this. for a little backstory, my boyfriend and i have been dating for six months now. the three of us in this story are in the same classes so we see each other very often. we're also into the same games so we play together with some other friends almost everyday. bf and i, i'll refer to him as a, got close through games mostly, but a lot of it was by talking to each other all the time and realizing we have a lot in common. his friend, b, however, is pretty shy when he's around people he's not close to. every friendship point i have with b is because of a, our common link. because of a, the three of us end up going to the same gatherings, parties, and any sort of event. here's the thing: i feel like i might be losing feelings for a. i've been feeling like this for a little while now, but it comes and goes. so many things he does now, mostly physical contact, give me ""the ick"", i cringe, i don't find him as attractive as i once have. and then, the feeling goes away and i think ""my, how could i ever even think about something like that?"" but b has never been anything other than nice to me. he apologizes after accidentally interrupting me, he opens doors for me and waits for me to walk through them first (a has never done that), offers me help when i need it, et cetera. i've noticed b is quite an affectionate guy, he likes hugs and physical touch. when a wants to do that kind of stuff with me, i'm uncomfy, and think that that's just not my way of expressing love. b had never been touchy with me before today, which is part of the reason why i've been feeling guilty. b invited me, a, and some other common friends to his house. i'm the only one who showed up, everyone else was busy. as a result, we had a blast, played different games, talked about our interests, laughed, and overall had fun. b was getting more and more touchy. what started with jokingly bumping on my shoulder and tapping on my head ended with cupping my face a lot when he talked to me, holding my hand for longer than he should, laying his head on my shoulder and chest for not more than a couple seconds, and putting his hand on my waist for a moment. all while we played videogames together, sitting quite closely to each other. at a certain point, i realized that if i didnt have a boyfriend, i might've already kissed b. i felt so bad but being with b was such a light cozy feeling, i didn't worry about what he was doing or what i should be doing. i started to think that maybe, just maybe, he felt it too. but then i realized that he is naturally touchy and maybe that's all. i thought i might be starting to crush on him, but i couldn't help thinking that it's just a spur of the moment type of thing, and that i'd soon be grossed out by him. a is an amazing boyfriend and always has been. he's so madly in love with me. he's my first relationship and i'm his first girlfriend too, so we have a lot to learn, but i do feel overlooked sometimes, even though i know he doesn't do it on purpose. we have an absurd amount of things in common and he checks everything on my list, in theory. but i feel like i've cheated on him after today, because i shouldn't just be holding his friend's hand or even being that physically close to b. a knows i spent the day with b and didn't say anything remarkable about it. i feel so so guilty and i feel like i'm stuck. i don't think it's fair for me to stay with a, but cutting contact with a means not speaking to b either. plus, there's a chance b is just being friendly. i don't know how to go on from now and i'm starting to feel physically sick from the guilt. i'll honestly take any help. tldr: my boyfriend's best friend makes me feel more comfortable and less overlooked than my own boyfriend does, and i think we might have feelings for each other.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,3.0,0.0037593984962406013,0.002506265664160401,0.09774436090225563,1.0,0.0
"he's becoming distant and i fear he no longer enjoys being round me my (21f) boyfriend (22m) have been dating for 3 years now. i met him when i went back to highschool after being out for 2 years. when i met him there was instantly just a strong connection between us but it became a bit rocky because i was afraid to get into a new relationship. i have never had the best experience with guys and just the year before i experienced something life changing and made my trust in men almost none existent. with him it was different though, but because of my actions we almost never dated. then we fixed our problems and he eventually asked me out. today we're in one of the most beautiful relationships and i honestly just love it. we've been through many ups and downs and always get through. i think it's also good to note that i have chronic anxiety and i tend to go into panicked episodes and tend to overthink. so to my issue. for a while i've noticed he's been very distant and tends to push me one side. it started with our conversations, when we'd speak over the phone or in person, he rarely heard what i said, or completely changes the subject halfway through. he never notices but eventually i just started keeping quiet, even bringing it up was useless. then he started chatting to me less, i'll send him a message and he'll reply hours later. it's always one word answers and he doesn't ever sound interested in anything i say. i tried changing topics, or keep the conversation going and he just doesn't seem interested. he normally picks me up every weekend for one day and lately it's always been a problem. it used to be, now it's always maybe i'll pick you up. granted he still makes an effort or just does it so i don't feel sad about it. but even when i'm there, he barely wants to spend time with me, talk to me. he's always on his phone. always busy on tiktok. before we started dating we spoke about how uncomfortable he is with people going through his phone because of stuff that happened in his past, i understand and was never nosy. but now it's just getting out of hand. we've been together for three years and he still doesn't allow me to be on it, fine that's not the problem but it's the other things he does. like conviently it's always missing out of site when i'm around. if i ask if i can watch tiktoks on his phone, it's always 'dead'. how do i know this is a lie? once i wanted to check the time on his phone, pressed the power button and it was off, so i just held the power button to power it on, it not only went on but showed 60% battery. once he looked for his phone, panicked and i showed him i had it because i grabbed it for him and i can not forget the look on his face. i don't want to be suspicious and i trust him but now it's starting to bother me more and more. i have his email on my phone, his fb account is logged into my phone. so sometimes i can see what he's doing what all he's on, if he's online on fb and who he searches on fb, but i can't see that on any of his other socials. what started making me more suspicious and sad a but hurt with pertaining to this was i'd send him a message but then he he wouldn't reply to me but he's online everywhere else. one day i even saw he had telegram and busy chatting there but never had time to message me. slowly but surely these things made me feel so insecure. what really contribute to it was when one day he was at my place i made him something to eat and brought to him, his back was to me. i saw him on tiktok and liking a girl's video. it didn't bother me at first but then i saw what she was doing in the video and the way he liked it and i just felt my heart drop. we had a conversation after that day but it just wasn't the same after that. i didn't feel comfortable anymore. i felt insecure. and that is also what lead to all these other things. and me looking for something, anything and i did end up finding some things that he explained but it was still a punch to the gut. and before you ask i have spoken to him, i do bring it up, i do try to speak to him about it. as for the attention part, i've practically begged him to stop treating me like this, to give me attention, i asked why he's chatting the way he is. and it lead to a conversation that's just slowly but surely turning my heart hard and i don't know what to do. he said his not interested in the conversations with me anymore. he asked me not to come to him this weekend because he feels we need space, ok rightfully so i don't mind but then i asked him then don't ignore me the entire time. i don't know what to do. i'm not completely innocent, i know. the way i bring up stuff, speak to him and act on my emotions can sometimes be extremely demeaning. and i'm trying to work on that. i'm trying not to be controlling or someone that is so clingy i guess. so i need advice, how do i go about working on this with him. i don't want to argue anymore. i want us to be better, i know constantly having to try to make me happy is not healthy for our relationship because he has his own life as well so i need advice on what i should do going forward. and please no, leave him or he's cheating replies, i want real hard truth advice on how to go about this as an adult, and how to mature in my relationship instead of just running away from this problem.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,3.0,0.002859866539561487,0.002859866539561487,0.09723546234509056,1.0,0.0
"my girlfriend thinks my girl space friend is crossing boundaries. i (19m) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (20f) for over 3 years, i’ve known her for 5. i’ve known my other friend (20f) for around the same time. my friend, who’ll we’ll call greta, and i, talk a lot. greta sometimes asks for things like for me to buy her expensive clothes and food and a lot of stuff. she also begs me to hang out with her and we shared locations. my girlfriend didn’t mind this until one day, while looking in my find my app (not to snoop, but to look for something important on the app), saw that i had greta’s location. my girlfriend (who we’ll call fran) questioned me and asked me why she had my location, and i said it was because she asked and i gave it. she said she felt uncomfortable so i stopped letting greta have my location. i thought it was dumb, sure, but i did for her security. a couple of days later, greta questions why we stopped sharing locations. i state my girlfriend was uncomfortable. greta said that fran was insecure and that we couldn’t have anything because of her, and thar fran didn’t like her and was controlling. i didn’t back fran up and agreed that i thought the decision was stupid. this was two weeks ago. however, today, fran found out, and she was livid. she was pissed that i would basically let greta say these things about her, especially when some of them weren’t true. she also found it weird that greta reacted badly to the location thing, especially when greta expressed that she only does it for fun and that she doesn’t care or check. she basically thinks now that greta doesn’t know her place as her friend and she doesn’t know boundaries because she says greta made up lies about her because she had never said anything bad about greta, and that she stated a boundary and that we basically shat all over her. she stated that she needed a boyfriend who was going to defend her from people who say bad things about her. fran says it’s up to me who i’m friends with but she’s extremely hurt i let greta say all this stuff without backing her up. i do agree that now after talking that some of greta’s behavior is weird but i don’t know what else to do. any advice? edit: woah, thanks for the much needed brutally honest advice. when i get up tomorrow, i’m going to talk to my girlfriend and tell her everything, and then i will deal with greta. tl;dr: my girl best friend crosses boundaries, talked about my girlfriend, girlfriend is pissed. don’t know what to do.",advice,0,2510.0,485.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09690721649484536,1.0,0.0

"i’ve been more emotional but i feel like i’m trying more than he is. i (22f) am 38 weeks pregnant and in a relationship with my boyfriend (24m) of 4 years. the pregnancy was a surprise. for majority of the pregnancy its been a rough ride, i’ve barely had any sleep to the point where every other day my eye is twitching from the lack of sleep. i’ve come to realize when he rubs my back, i have better luck of falling asleep. or even if he just talks about random stuff with me until i zone out and fall asleep. i learned to not ask for that during the week days when he has work the next morning. when he doesn’t get his full 8 hours of sleep, its not a pretty sight. so tonight, a friday, here i am having trouble sleeping. i asked him if he could either stay awake with me or if he could rub me. he rubs me for about a minute and falls asleep himself. its only 10:30pm. when he’s out with friends, he can be up until 3am (this happens every other weekend). another note: he schedules a surgery less than a month after his child is born, he sends me a text saying i have surgery on -insertdate-. thats it, nothing else about it so i’m thinking okay he’s driving home, he’ll let me know more about it when he comes home. i was wrong, 2 hours go by he’s not home, he went to his friends to tell them details about it first. so for those 2 hours i’m coming up with the worst cases. when he feels like the nesting part of the pregnancy is becoming too much work, he complains to his friends that i’m asking for too much/ doing too much. when i ask this one time on a night that he’ll still be able to get his sleep, he tells me that i’m asking for too much. so obviously here i am crying while typing this up because hormones of the pregnancy make me emotional. every time he goes off on me, i let it slide because i know he doesn’t mean it. i’ll still straight up tell him he needs to calm down/take a breather before he continues. sometimes it escalates a little too far and he will just keep talking about stuff i know he doesn’t realize he is saying. he’s been cutting down his smoking and drinking intake to try to be sober for when our baby is born. so it’s just withdrawal talking not him. it upsets me that when it comes down to trying to be there for me or helping me with something, he doesn’t have the time for it. but when it involves his friends! its game changer, he does anything for them. i know i’m just being over dramatic, i dealt with my fair share of withdrawal at the beginning of this pregnancy as i stopped drinking and smoking cold turkey. it’s hard to deal with. maybe i’m just jealous about the fact that he puts more towards his friends than me. that might just be my perspective. i kicked him out of room tonight and told him to either sleep on the couch or go to his friends house since it’s such an inconvenience to help me. now i feel awful. i guess this was more a rant than anything.",advice,0,2914.0,593.0,0.0,0.0,0.0016863406408094434,0.08600337268128162,0.0,0.0

"advice on next step in this scenario? i (22m) matched with a girl (24f) i knew from back in high school on bumble, we became super close over the last month. we’d text all day and night, we hung out 5-6 times just casually over that month. we began dating officially after we kissed one of those nights, but before we had begun dating officially we had some deep conversations about both of us dealing with depression and previous experiences in relationships. she had her first relationship earlier this year and was cheated on by him, they were only together for 6ish months. it’s been about 4 months since their breakup. 3 days after we had became official, she broke things off because of outside factors among her not recognizing she’s still heartbroken over that relationship failing and an ongoing depressive episode. which i fully understand, heartbreak on top of clinical depression sucks so we ended things on good/open ended terms. i did tell her though i don’t think it’s fair for me to remain close with her while i still have feelings for her to more or less protect myself from being hurt any more i guess. it’s been about 2 ish weeks since we’ve spoke. deep down i would love to be close with this person and explore those emotions down the road, whenever she has healed from her heartbreak. we’ve both acknowledged that there is chemistry. (which reading back in my brain sounds like i’m waiting for her, but i’m not going out of my way to find anything atm as i’ve uninstalled any dating app and don’t want to dive back into that rabbit hole.) now the question is, i’d like to buy her some flowers maybe at the start of the new year as not only a way to kinda check in and see how she’s doing mentally in terms of her depression, but to show her that someone cares for her as a person, start the new year off with a little bit of joy and become friends again occasionally hanging out at some point. do you think this is a good idea or do you think it could come off as too romantic and appear as if i’m only trying to date her again? i’m not trying to force anything romantic/relationship wise with her, knowing she’s emotionally unavailable.",advice,0,2160.0,410.0,5.0,0.012195121951219513,0.0024390243902439024,0.07073170731707316,2.0,0.0

"i need help dealing with my jealousy throwaway account! also sorry for the babbling i think that me (f20) and my boyfriend (m21) have been together for about 4 years and have quite a healthy way to deal with my constant jealousy, i usually just tell him how i am feeling, and he validates my feelings and tells me how much he loves me and there’s no need for me to feel this way, i also never prohibit him from going out with his friends, but recently i’ve been feeling way too jealousy and it’s getting super annoying. well, my boyfriend has a university group of friends that are quite… interesting… they’re often mean to him and put him down, when i asked him why he puts up with it he just tells me he rather have bad friends than be all alone, and they’re the least bad group of people in his class, needless to say after hearing way too much stories about his friends being mean to him i really don’t like them, i tried hanging out with them as a group but honestly i can’t put away from my mind the stories and just feel uncomfortable the entire time. the problem comes from my insecurities as a person, i don’t feel like i’m special and every time he goes out with friends i guess i’m scared he will have more fun with them than he has with me and noticed he doesn’t need me anymore, i know it’s dumb but i can’t help it, i feel horrible for feeling bad that my boyfriend is having fun with anyone else and i understand it’s extremely toxic, although i never act on my jealousy (ex. getting mad at him, prohibiting him from going out etc) i just wish i didn’t feel this way anymore, i wish i could be happy for him. and it’s the small details that get me, i get fixated on the smallest details, like, he was invited to a friend’s presentation, i think its a acting thing, i’m not sure, i ask him to not give me much details or else i feel terrible, anyway, i was a bit surprised of how quickly he accepted to go, when i have my important events i have to beg him to come and i’m often replied with “i will see” “i will need to check with my mom” “my mom thinks i’ve been going out too much” (obs: his mom is quite a controlling person and probably a narcissist, so he often has to walk around eggshells when it comes to her, i understand this and know it’s not his fault, also he has a serious disease that makes moving out basically impossible once he is extremely financially dependable on her and the health plan) (obs2: completely forgot to say i’m from a foreign country where it’s common to still live with our parents until we are settled, married or they die) but when it came to her thing it’s just “yeah im going” to be fair he probably had to talk to his mom as well and yeah, i ask him to not tell me too much about the details but holy shit it’s eating me inside the thought he is dedicating himself more to his friends than to me, my mind goes directly to “yeah ofc im so annoying he probably wants to spend time with them and not with me” anyway, i often talk to him about my feelings, he always explains himself (even tho he doesn’t have to) just to make me feel loved and a bit more calm, he is such a sweetheart, feel like i got a jackpot and im so scared to lose him, i really need help to deal with all this jealousy, i am going to therapy for other issues and we haven’t touched that problem yet, my therapist is currently in a vacation and my bf has a bunch of end of the year hangouts he has to go, i really need a way to deal with it in the short term until i can talk about it with my therapist because all this jealousy, and honestly envy, is eating me inside :( tldr: i am extremely jealous of my boyfriend and im looking for a way to deal with it.",advice,0,3683.0,687.0,2.0,0.0026702269692923898,0.0013351134846461949,0.1081441922563418,0.0,0.0

"(27m) my girlfriend (26f) is struggling more and more with her adhd lately yet seems opposed to any sort of help. how can i best communicate my concerns? evening all, hoping that i'm posting this in the right place. also my apologies for any typos, on mobile. my girlfriend (26f) and i (27m) have been together for going on two years now. when we first started dating she told me right up front that she had adhd, as well as anxiety disorders. i struggle with the latter as well so i'm certainly not one to judge, and at the time she seemed to have a good handle on her mental health. for the first year and a half or so occasionally she'd have minor issues with remembering things, getting distracted from time to time, sometimes getting a little overwhelmed/over stimulated, but all in all was doing well. that started to change about six months ago. she started forgetting things like what days she was working, putting off tasks until the last possible minute and then spiraling down into panic attacks because of it. she'll get distracted in the middle of a conversation to look at something on her phone and forget what we were talking about. now i don't have adhd, so won't claim to understand exactly what she's going through or how much of a struggle it is, but i'm still very concerned. it's not just innocent distractions and sometimes getting a little over stimulated. she has left a hot iron plugged in until it almost melted through the ironing board. a while ago she forgot to close the fridge door and didn't notice until everything had spoiled inside (this has happened twice). this genuinely makes me worried for her safety at times. i also have the feeling it's affected her anxiety as well. she doesn't like going to the store or being out in public unless i'm there as well to help calm her down. she asks me to make phone calls on her behalf because she's too anxious to do it herself. i brought up my concerns with her, explaining that i care deeply about her and want her to do well, and that it might be beneficial for her to seek out some sort of help, whether that be therapy or medication or something else. when i told her how i felt she got very apologetic and kept saying how it's all her fault, how she feels like a terrible person, etc etc. i tried helping her find a therapist (as she had expressed a desire to get back into therapy on a few occasions). but each time i showed her one that seemed promising, including ones specializing in adult adhd, she had a reason to turn them down. they looked too old, they didn't seem nice, they looked scary, etc etc. she seems even more opposed to medication, saying that it'll make her feel even worse. i feel awful saying this but it's starting to affect me as well. there are days i feel more like a parent than her partner. constantly having to make sure she's not forgetting things, getting distracted in the middle of important tasks. and the fact that she seems to look for any reason to avoid getting help is getting a bit disheartening. i really want her to feel better and be happier, since i can tell this is starting to impact her overall mental health and self-image. that's where i could really use some help. i want to communicate this to her without coming across as selfish or like i'm blaming her for these issues, because i understand she doesn't have direct control over them. generally speaking we have great communication but i'm just trying to find a way to get my concerns across without sounding like an absolute toolbag. tl;dr: girlfriend is really struggling with adhd and it's starting to affect our relationship, but doesn't seem to want to get any sort of help for it.",advice,0,3674.0,671.0,1.0,0.0014903129657228018,0.0029806259314456036,0.04769001490312966,1.0,0.0

i seriously don’t even have a gut instinct here. i am at a complete loss. my current boyfriend makes me very happy but i’m clearly not over my ex year and that’s not fair to my current boyfriend. he makes me so happy and i know we would have such an amazing future without a doubt. either way i lose in a way.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,7.5,0.011527377521613832,0.012487992315081652,0.11335254562920269,1.0,0.0

"i feel like a massive asshole i'm (29) in desperate need of advice. keeping things as concise as possible, it'll still be long, so here's the rundown: i met this person in middle school, and liked talking to them in classes we had together. had no intention of hanging out outside of school. one day when my dad comes to pick me up from school he sees us talking and invites them over on my behalf, thinking it's what i'd want. i didn't. but i didn't know how to express that i wanted what i'd now call a ""work friendship."" can have a great time chatting at work, but not want to hang out outside of work. but we did become much closer, and spent more time together outside of school, even if at times i found them annoying, or clueless, or bewildering. i also cared about them and wanted them to be doing well. and as a picky asshole that keeps few friends, they ended up someone i spent a lot of time with. and as a teenager with few friends, i didn't have much reference for how most people are. had to move away for a few years at 18, and am bad at long distance anything. moved back and into a house with them and others to get out of a bad situation, they really did me a solid. after spending so much time away, certain aspects of their personality stuck out a lot more, like how hyper defensive they still were. occasionally their tone can be so combative that it makes me, someone with a weak spine, not want to say anything contrary, even if it's something that'd be good for them to hear. and it sucks for us both because i know they genuinely don't intend for their tone to sound as such, but it's the kind of thing that flips a switch that i'm still learning to get control of, where i'll just automatically avoid whatever pressed their button. they even straight up asked me if they get overly defensive/combative and i believe my response was ""not really."" and then there was them talking to our landlord without going over it with the group first even though how they see one of us would impact all of us. and then basically the same thing happening at the next house. covid had just hit and they asked the landlord about pausing rent temporarily, without talking to the whole house first. they ended up moving out anyway, and when the lease was up the landlords told us they ""want to try to sell instead of rent."" even though they liked us up until that point, and the place is still being rented out. their message is of course not for sure the reason we couldn't renew, but it couldn't have helped, and then we had to find a new place during the first summer of the pandemic. and their cousin that had moved in with us all explicitly so the two of them could find a place together was also left with us, which was a bit hard because their cousin was living on disability payments and couldn't contribute as much towards rent. so then a year or so later, we'd had a tiny bit of chat on messenger in the mean time but hadn't seen each other and they wanted to hang out. and i said i didn't want to. they asked when i did want to. and i said that i didn't. and today they finally asked why. it'd felt really slow and like a long time coming but at the same time kinda fast and all at once. i think they're a good person, and i wish them the best, but i don't wish to spend time with them or to be in communication. like. i think our whole connection was basically neurodivergently hyperfixating on something we both liked and infodumping back and forth, and having some good conversation, and that was all i wanted. and i don't need that now. and now i have friends whom i care for in a much different way. it doesn't matter if we like the same things. or if we're states apart. i want to hear about their personal lives. and there aren't times when i question if i like or respect them. and i don't know how to answer my old friends question of why i've broken things off in a way that is compassionate, and not ""too much"". this feels like one of those things where i'm in so deep i just can't see the simple solution. please advise me. i feel like an idiot.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,3.0,0.0038461538461538464,0.00641025641025641,0.07051282051282051,0.0,0.0

"husband’s favorite line is “i’ll do it later.” how can i bring up our current division of labour at home without it turning into a tit-for-tat fight? like many progressive, millennial couples, my husband (m34) and i (f32) try to equitably split household tasks as much as possible. it’s definitely not a perfect 50-50 split, i do a lot of the “invisible labour” and take on a lot of the mental load (appointments, holidays, etc.) whereas he does a lot of the maintenance work (he does it for a living, so it makes sense). childcare is very much a shared task and he’s a great and very involved dad. while i’ve been off on parental leave, i’ve been happy to take on a larger share since i’m home most of the day and my husband works in a labour-intensive job so is often tired at the end of the day. (that said, as the main breadwinner, this is for sure going to change when i’m back at work) but regardless of who works what hours or where, we both live in our house, so its upkeep is a shared responsibility. as indicated in the title, discussions surrounding division of labour often devolve into comparisons of who does what in the house - which is not at all productive. an issue that i’d really like to bring up with him is that often his response to me asking him to do something is “i’ll do it later.” however, many times (obviously not all the time, but enough to be an issue for me) it just doesn’t get done at all or i end up having to do it myself (while hearing apologies for “forgetting”). or if i ask again, i get accused of nagging. by no means do i expect him to drop everything that very second to get it done, but i would like it done in a reasonable timeframe. like before he leaves for work, or sits down to play video games, or goes to bed. the times i have tried to raise it as an issue, he feels like i don’t recognize or appreciate all the things he does do around the house or it becomes an argument about who does more. i want to bring this up and discuss it constructively - otherwise, it’ll keep building tension and resentment between us. so people of reddit, how should i bring this up without having him go on the defensive right away? tldr; how do i ask my husband to stop procrastinating on tasks without nagging or it becoming a fight about labour division?",advice,0,2291.0,448.0,4.0,0.008928571428571428,0.002232142857142857,0.06473214285714286,3.0,0.0

"boyfriend (m19) is mentally destroying me (f19) and doesn’t care this is pretty lengthy so i apologize in advance so i’ve (f19) been dating my boyfriend (m19) for ten months and a month after we started dating, we became long distance since i had to study abroad. so for just some background, my boyfriend and i are absolutely in love with each other. despite being far apart, we talk on the phone all the time. whenever i’m not studying, i call him and he calls me whenever even while he's at work, taking a shower, etc. he’s also the only one who has ever made me feel protected since he watches out for me a whole lot. however though i once thought that our relationship was perfect, i’ve now just realized that it isn’t, and i just think that my mental health has been suffering ever since we got together and i’m only now noticing it because of a couple main things. first of all, he’s said that ever since we started talking, i’ve motivated him to finally get his ged, a job, a car, and learn to love himself while i, on the other hand, have lost all motivation which caused me start failing in school, ditch friends and family, lose all self confidence and it's all happened since i’ve started talking to him. and i know it’s my fault for maybe becoming too attached but it’s just too late. secondly, i simply just can’t do any of the things i used to do. though, i don’t know if this point is worth making because it could be normal but regardless it’s taking a toll on me. he won't let me hang out with my friends and hates when i go out, even if it's just to the mall by myself, i was forced to get rid of my brother's old clothes that were passed down to me, as well as a brand new projector that he gave me as a present and that my boyfriend had forced me to give up because of his jealousy. he didn't like most of my piercings so he made me remove them, he bans me from wearing anything with short sleeves or that is more revealing, from wearing shorts that are shorter than mid-thigh, and from wearing anything that isn't ""baggy."" thirdly, he practically shoves his opinions down my throat and gets angry for not agreeing. it’s like i have to agree with him on everything, whether it be political or just random, or he gets frustrated and ignores me because he thinks i’m just irritating for having my own opinion. we even once got into a big argument about how to pronounce ""pecan,"" and it ended with me essentially being forced to apologize. he also snapped when i didn’t agree with him on his opinion that my depression medication doesn’t work and is instead a scam when i disagrees that it is and only i can determine that. i don’t ever judge his beliefs or opinions but when it comes to me, it’s all he does. fourthly, him and i literally just don’t align morally. my boyfriend is incredibly homophobic, racist, sexist, and everything else. he constantly uses the n-word, believes that women should just not express their concerns ever, names people from the middle east as “sand n-words,"" and just says a million other disturbing things. telling him to stop only makes him angrier so i've learned to ignore him. i know that its a major red flag and that i should’ve left when i first heard it but i didn’t and i take responsibility for that. finally, and most importantly, he constantly talks about himself. so this last point is important because it's what, in all honesty, pushed me over the edge. my life is a complete mess, and recently, as a result, my mental health has been getting worse and have just been having suicidal thoughts. i barely make it through school, have no friends (because of him), no longer have any family, have lost my job, have legal issues with an ex, and this relationship has just been draining me. he’s aware of my condition too and has been consoling me throughout since he freaked out when i mentioned splitting up with him and has been working extra hard to prevent that from happening. he also at one point, forced me into sending nudes after i told him i was uncomfortable and suffering from trauma from my past relationship because of it. and with that, he told me that i had to put up with it since our relationship depends on him seeing me; otherwise, we just wouldn't work properly. i tried to tell him that i still don't feel at all comfortable, but instead of convincing him, he argued that i need to stop talking so much about myself and forget about how i felt and so i just gave in. what got me to reevaluate everything was after my grandmother passed away which was two weeks ago and have as a result, traumatized me to the point where i was unable to eat or get out of bed. that night, when i called him that night, crying to the point where i couldn’t breathe and just wanted to get some comfort, he slept out on me so i took some sleeping pills and sobbed myself to sleep. and this happened for a week straight where he wouldn’t acknowledge how i might’ve been feeling and not being there for me (he knows what happened through a friend). i finally talked to him about it and said that i’m not trying to be dependent but simply need a listening ear; he doesn't need to give me anything, just some attention for at least a short while. instead, he became angry, telling me that he works and is too tired to listen to me cry but i apparently wouldn’t understand because i lost my job. he then said i should just be grateful and instead pointed out the things that i do that annoy him. i’ve had so much pent up inside of me because of my grandmothers death and every thing else i was forced to suppress and i’m just burnt out. he’s also planning on proposing next year and getting a place for us but i’m not sure. i simply just never feel understood and am always afraid to express my feelings out loud because we would just fight so it isn’t worth it. he also bought a plane ticket for me to fly out and see him in two days. i’m scared and sick just thinking about it, but he has been over the moon excited, telling everyone around him and even breaking down in tears from being so excited. i’m still in pain and grieving and i’m just plain sick of this. i just want out because it’s ruining my mental health and making me lose myself. i want to know whether i’m overreacting, if i should still go see him, and if not, how can i break the news to him so last minute that i’m not coming to visit?",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,5.0,0.0040290088638195,-0.0008058017727639,0.10475423045930701,1.0,0.0

"the girl i've been seeing (27f) says she doesn't know what she wants yet and doesn't want to be exclusive, but i (24m) am just getting mixed signals. so for context, last month i decided i would get into the dating scene after a rough year, i figured i'd try to look for a relationship, as my life had become stale and i had just become a lonely mess. i had never been in a relationship before in my life, and have never even attempted to talk to a girl before in my life. anyways i match with this girl on bumble, we hit it off, and i invite her to go out for coffee. i was incredibly anxious to the point where i was shaking, but the date went fantastic. we both had strong career goals, values, and interests, she laughs at everything i say, etc... she texted me immediately after she got home, told me she told all of her friends about me and said i shouldn't be nervous at all around her. said she thought i was the cutest thing in the world and we could take things slow as i get into my first relationship. fast forward to the second date. we had been messaging constantly the week before. we go out for breakfast, then go back to her place. the date again goes great and we hang out the entire day. we're also making out for what must have been hours. i'm thinking that she is looking for a relationship out of this because she's been sending me snapchats of her family, her baby nieces, and nephews, telling me how her friends think i'm the real catch. the following week were sending snaps back and forth constantly again. on the third date, i invite her back to my place, i cook dinner for the two of us, and we're watching a movie. the date seems to be going great, we're making out again. but then she drops a bomb and says she doesn't want any exclusivity because she's going away for 2 months for her job, and she wasn't ready to get back into a relationship after her 7-year breakup with an abusive ex and was just seeing what other options were out there. she said that she is still seeing multiple guys whilst talking to me and that if i was looking for a relationship then we shouldn't have sex as she didn't want to see me get hurt as she (correctly) assumed i'd fall for her pretty quickly. i thought about it for a bit as we were together, and we did end up having sex (the first time i've ever had sex if that matters...). i ask if she'd like to hang out again and she said she'd love to. but now i have absolutely no idea what to do. the day after she's still sending me snapchats of her family and friends, talking about me, and asking about what my friends thought about her. the thing is, i would like to be exclusive with this girl, but she's going away for 2 months in a few weeks and was pretty open about how she had been seeing other guys. it's only been 3 dates, but i was wondering if i should keep going or just cut ties completely. if i'm being honest with myself, i do not want to put more effort into more dates if she's sleeping with like 2 or 3 other guys still, and is just going to ditch me when she goes away for 2 months. she said she'd never consider being exclusive with me right now as she just didn't know what she wants yet, but in the future, she'd be open to a relationship, just not right now. also, we are probably going to have sex again on the fourth date. i'm just confused because she's talking to me constantly about her family and friends, and vice versa for me as well. is she doing this with the other guys that she's been talking to? i feel like if i'm just a fwb, then she wouldn't be sending me pictures of her friends and family constantly. i think at the moment i'm just a passing fling for her, but i was wondering what all of your opinions were. should i cut ties or keep pursuing it? i really do not have the energy to focus on multiple girls either, so that is completely out of the question. i don't think i would want to anyways. but yeah, should i go on the fourth date or should i cut ties? tldr: first relationship ever goes on for 3 great dates. the girl is leaving for 2 months in a few weeks and is still seeing other guys, doesn't want exclusivity, and is unsure of what she wants. i want a relationship, so i am wondering if i should still keep in contact with this girl.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,5.0,0.0060901339829476245,-0.00243605359317905,0.08160779537149818,3.0,0.0

boyfriend and i got into an argument and he almost killed himself so i don’t really know what to do. i got out of a very toxic relationship years ago and i promised myself i wouldn’t start the cycle of abuse again. however the past few weeks my new boyfriend and i have been having issues with communication. before leaving for christmas break i had a whole day of christmas festivities planned. it was the week of my finals but i prioritize holidays even tho he does not. our thanksgiving was terrbible and he said he was going to be better for christmas and he just wasn’t used to it. however he didn’t come home after work for the christmas stuff. it got too late and everything had to get cancelled. i was very hurt but when he came home he didn’t say much. i brought it up and he started yelling at me. he randomly gave a sincere apology after he got done yelling and it was hard to respond. a few minutes past and he got up and left the bedroom to lay out the couch. i begged him not to leave but he said he would come back. he didn’t and i’m the morning i went to get him because i needed to be comforted. we started yelling again and my landlord threatened to pull my lease for noise complaints. i spiraled into a panic attack and he helped me despite us arguing. however right when i calmed down he left to help his friend with his car. this isn’t like him and i begged him to come back soon because i knew i wasn’t okay. he didn’t and he came back an hour before we needed to leave for a big even. my eyes were swollen shut from crying but i still got ready because i had been looking forward to the event for months. i was struggling very badly but i wanted to push through. it was for his work and it meant a lot to him as much as it meant to me. however he didn’t acknowledge anything that had happened between us and i started crying on my way there. he was yelling at me to get better but i couldn’t drop everything even though i tried. we go through the event and it seemed like he didn’t want to be around me. he was with his work friends so i went to the bathroom. i’m narcoleptic and i fell asleep while i’m there. 30 minutes went by and he was pissed when i came out. i just wanted to relieve him of me being a party pooper but he was pissed i left him. he went on about him saying he did everything for me to feel included and it’s my fault for not pulling it together. the fight got worse and he started yelling at me in front of everyone outside the venue. i was so embarrassed and i didn’t raise my voice back. i just took it but he kept on going. i was sobbing in a puddle while he just screamed at me. i pushed him when he got into my face and i felt terrible. he is a big lan so i in no way could hurt him like this but he freaked out saying i was abusing him. i felt terrible but the yelling wouldn’t stop. i ran off into the car and the yelling continued and i couldn’t take it any more. i completely dissociated and was just sitting there sobbing. i told him i never wanted to see him again out of anger and i continued to cry on the floor of the car. w hi we’re supposed to go to a hotel but we didn’t and he dropped me off. i told him he didn’t love me because the way he talked to me and he thought i said i never loved him. i would never say this bc i had this said to me in an argument in my past relationship and it broke me. he drove away and i checked his location and he went to the hotel. then all of a sudden his location turned off and he sent me this long paragraph that seemed suspicious because he said “you’ll be taken care of when i’m gone”. i knew he was talking about life insurance and i freaked out. i sent texts and calls but nothing was going through. he had been suicidal in the past but that was before me. when he finally answered he said he was going to walk into traffic but he’s going to the hospital to get help. i messaged his best friend and his friend said he didn’t say anything about killing himself. i don’t want to think he used suicide as a form of manipulation but the situation seems so twisted. he never went to the hospital and he just stayed with his friend. i am just thankful he is okay but i mourned him for minutes on the phone and he refuses to acknowledg how this has affected me. i’d it wasn’t for what i said then he would have never done that. but also i don’t feel like i said that bad of a thing to cause him to kill himself like that after an argument. the next morning he woke up fine but i have been a mess. i thought i lost him and i thought it was all my fault. i haven’t eaten and i can’t sleep without the stress. i ended up apologizing for everything and took accountability for causing the fight and instead of him taking accountability of his stuff he just added onto the list of things i needed to better at in the future. when i brought up how he can’t threaten to kill himself like that then go silent because it was traumatizing all he said was “imagine how it was for me if i was about to do it”. i feel like i don’t want to be insensitive but i mourned his death just for him to call me and say he didn’t go to the hospital for help. i want to just

"husband refuses bjs, thinks i don't desire him because i have pain during intercourse. because i am in pain during intercourse throwaway. my (34f) husband (30m) and i have been together for 4 years. we have a great relationship. we rarely argue. we trust each other. he helps me around the house and is truly a partner. we laugh together a lot and truly enjoy each other's company. the only problem is in the bedroom. i have a genetic connective tissue disease, combined with terrible endometriosis that has resulted in over 13 abdominal surgeries and even a partial hysterectomy. i often have a lot of pain in that area and intercourse often hurts. when this happens i try to go down on my husband because i still want to pleasure him. i get excited by him getting excited. i don't need intercourse to feel satisfied. however, he doesn't see it this way. he insists that i don't desire him and so he doesn't want me to go down on him because he doesn't want charity. i try to touch him and get him aroused but he can't stay hard. i can't help but think it might be because i have gained some weight since we met due to surgery and hospitalizations and not being able to exercise regularly. he says he likes my body but in the past he asked me to lose weight. he claims he changed his mind and i don't really need to but i think he is saying that so he doesn't hurt my feelings. i am a dress size 6-8 on average, hourglass shape with some curves. every woman i see him looking at (on insta or that his friends send, or even his old dating profile matches before we were together) are very skinny women. not a single one has a body anything like mine. so i wonder if i just don't turn him on anymore and he is trying to turn it around on me. i feel so fat now and i am trying hard to lose weight, but until the weight is gone i am very set conscious. i actually want to lose the weight, not just because he wants me to. so basically it seems like each of think the other one isn't interested. he rejects me if i'm hurting and doesn't understand that even if i'm in pain or tired, that doesn't mean i don't still desire him. i have explained many times. i have tried talking about it. i don't feel sexy or attractive ever since he asked me to lose weight. i don't know what to do. any advice? eta: we aren't having any kind of sex right now. he doesn't ignore my pain or keep going if it hurts. i can tell when it is going to hurt so i just try to do other things for him and he rejects it all.",advice,0,2492.0,483.0,0.0,0.0,-0.010351966873706004,0.10559006211180125,1.0,0.0

"comment hello friend, i have read your publication and let me tell you that your relationship is somewhat rushed, after two months of dating, are you asking him to marry she? friend let me tell you something, a dating relationship is something beautiful until the most difficult test that a couple can experience arrives. do you know what this test is?... coexistence between couples, you've only been dating for two months with great difficulty, i think they know their hobbies, their tastes, to make a marriage a reality i suggest that they take a year of relationship so they realize how complicated it is. your partner for travel and work reasons travels a lot, so how do you want your marriage to flourish if you don't dedicate enough time to each other. you feel insecure about the relationship that your partner may have with another man, let me tell you that since the two of you have not forged a true relationship then it is most likely that she can cheat on you in the future, in case she is not doing so now (i hope the latter is not happening). my opinion for you is that: 1) tell her that you want to postpone the marriage for at least a year and that you want to continue being a boyfriend with her; 2) both should sit down and talk seriously and what they expect from this relationship and their prospects for the future; 3) they should go to a couples counselor and you should go to a counselor to treat your insecurity problem because with you you have insecurities and your current partner having depression, she needs an emotional pillar to comfort herself and she is vulnerable for another to come man and half give him that emotional support that you are not providing him; you say you love her but you can't be her emotional pillar because of your insecurities? i am honest that relationship is not going anywhere until you take the trust and leadership to try to save the relationship; this sucks friend but the truth is that at this moment you should support her and encourage her, comfort her and make her feel loved to try to combat her depression; try to get her time with you and do recreational activities for couples, try to get both of you to travel to different tourist places, show her that life is fun and above all make her feel loved. why am i telling you this?... here on reddit i have read several stories where the girlfriend/wife has depression and she is looking for a man to comfort herself and feel loved so she tries to find out what causes this depression, either because of an environment toxic family or it is purely due to your relationship because if it is the latter i recommend you end that relationship since it is not healthy for the mental / emotional state of both.",advice,0,2721.0,492.0,0.0,0.0,0.012195121951219513,0.024390243902439025,4.0,0.0

"comment it's generally bad advice to say ""sleep with someone you don't want to sleep with,"" haha... i would say it's justifiable to not want to sleep with someone who sleeps with someone you know. it can introduce all kinds of, like, competitiveness and comparison and whatever. it affects all the relationships involved. i don't think you have to feel the way you do, like maybe it's work you'd want to do to manage how it's affecting your relationships or whatever, but it's not just weird personal bugaboo that people should look at you sideways for. that's the rub with setting boundaries or whatever. i'm someone, i do think it's technically a punishment and therefore to that extent controlling to say, ""i don't want to sleep with someone who sleeps with my friends, if you sleep with my friends i won't sleep with you,"" my point is just you're justified in doing that. some people want to say, ""you're free to do what you want, but everyone else is free to do what they want, too,"" where they're trying super hard to say ""we're all just free freedom lovers loving freedom,"" but i think we've got to be realistic that we're all kind of beholden to other people's control of our lives. if you play a multiplayer game with any concept of self-preservation or just general goal-orientation, you're not free to do whatever you want--you've got to be aware of how other players affect your game. you're not in total control. you win some, you lose some, and sometimes there's no lesson of what you should've done differently to get what you want. sometimes all you can do is respond to events as they unfold.",advice,0,1609.0,288.0,1.0,0.003472222222222222,0.003472222222222222,0.034722222222222224,0.0,0.0

"comment hi op. at the request of u/mckittenman, i'm adding my own advice to you about your situation. it sounds to me like you're having a hard time processing your emotions. i'm not going to get into the ins and outs of your possible mental health issues - one thing i will say is that if you have been going to counselling for 9 months (assuming you've been going consistently every week or fortnight) and there has been little change, i'd suggest seeking another therapist and another therapy model. with regard to your issue, it sounds to me like your partner is drained. 10 months is a long time to wait for anyone to ""show up"" - and by ""show up"" he clearly means show the means of meeting the basic needs of a romantic relationship: affection. he listed a few of his grievances - imbalance of chores, no initiation of physical or emotional affection. i'm curious - how do you show your affection and love, if not by words, physical or acts? because it's clear he feels as though he has had an absence of affection for 10 months. if that is truly the case, then, i'm sorry, but he deserves better, and you do indeed need to ""show up"". you state that showing affection makes you uncomfortable. you need to weigh up your discomfort against your partner's absence and see which one hurts you more - because he is close to leaving. things which are uncomfortable become more comfortable as we do it. you can start small, but consistent. holding his hand out of nowhere every now and again. hugging him. kissing him. just make a reminder on your phone to tell him you love him. taking the time and effort to do these things will tell your bf that you love him. and if you can't do that, then you need to cut him loose, because he does deserve better. good luck.",advice,0,1761.0,318.0,2.0,0.006289308176100629,0.018867924528301886,0.015723270440251572,1.0,0.0

"comment **yes, she checks all four.** sid, i suggest you see a psychologist to obtain a professional opinion on what you're dealing with. my concern is that the 4 behaviors described above are red flags for bpd (borderline personality disorder), which my exw has. i caution that bpd is not something -- like chickenpox -- that a person either ""has"" or ""doesn't have."" instead, it is a spectrum disorder, which means everyone occasionally exhibits all bpd traits to some degree (usually at a low level if the person is healthy). bpd traits are primitive defenses that, when used appropriately and in moderation, increase our chances of survival. at issue, then, is not whether your exgf exhibits bpd traits. of course she does. we all do. rather, at issue is whether she exhibits those traits at a strong and persistent level (i.e., is on the upper end of the bpd spectrum). importantly, i'm not suggesting your exgf has full-blown bpd. only a professional can determine that. instead, i'm suggesting you consider whether she may be a person with many strong bpd symptoms (i.e., may be a ""pwbpd""). **i was immediately attracted to her.** sid, most pwbpd are good and caring individuals. their problem is not being bad but, rather, being unstable. indeed, a pwbpd typically exhibits the warmth, spontaneity, vulnerability, and purity of expressions that otherwise are seen only on the faces of young children. this is why pwbpd usually are very easy to fall in love with. it thus is not surprising that 3 of the world's most beloved women -- marilyn monroe, judy garland, and princess diana -- all had full-blown bpd if their biographers are correct. **she is extremely insecure about her looks.** if she is an untreated pwbpd, sid, she likely is very insecure about many things. i say this because bpd is believed to be caused by an inherited gene and/or by a childhood trauma (e.g., abuse or abandonment) occurring before age 5. because the trauma occurs so early, it blocks the child's emotional development at age 3 or 4. the child therefore has no opportunity to develop a strong stable sense of self identity -- and no opportunity to learn the many emotional skills needed to control her own emotions. this is why a pwbpd cannot learn those missing emotional skills by swallowing a pill or talking about her childhood. like a person learning to play a piano, the pwbpd must work hard for many years in a weekly training program (e.g., dbt) to acquire those missing skills. **she was punishing me harshly, abusing me and getting angry for the tiniest of things.** if your exgf is a pwbpd, sid, she carries much anger inside from early childhood. you therefore don't have to do a thing to create the anger. rather, you only have to do or say some minor thing that triggers a release of anger that is already there. this is why a pwbpd can burst into a rage in only a few seconds. moreover, the key defining characteristic of bpd is the inability to regulate one's own emotions, resulting in unstable behavior. this is why, outside the usa, most countries call this disorder *""emotionally unstable personality disorder""* (eupd). **she was physically abusing me, punching me in the face and kicking me.** sid, a substantial share of pwbpd never physically abuse their partners. many of them do, however. this is why more than 30 empirical studies have found the physical abuse of a spouse or partner to be strongly associated with bpd. and this is why *""intense, inappropriate anger""* is one of the 9 defining traits for bpd. indeed, the terms *""anger,"" ""impulsive behavior,""* and *""unstable""* appear in 4 of the [9 bpd symptoms]( the impulsive behavior refers to reckless actions like risky driving, eating disorders, unsafe sexual behavior, spending sprees, or drug abuse. **i truly loved this woman from the bottom of my heart.** if your exgf is a pwbpd, she likely loved you too. a pwbpd is capable of loving you very intensely -- but it is the very immature type of love you see in young children. this means she will occasionally flip -- in only seconds -- from jekyll (adoring you) to hyde (devaluing or hating you). and a few hours or days later, she can flip back again just as quickly. these rapid flips arise from a primitive defense called ""black-white thinking."" like a young child, a pwbpd never had an opportunity to learn the emotional skills needed to handle two strong conflicting feelings (e.g., love and hate) at the same time. this means she has great difficulty tolerating ambiguities, uncertainties, and the other gray areas of close interpersonal relationships. she thus will subconsciously split off the conflicting feeling, putting it far out of reach of her conscious mind. with young children, sid, this ""splitting"" is evident when the child will adore daddy while he's bringing out the toys but, in only a few seconds, will flip to hating daddy when he takes one toy away. importantly, this behavior does not mean that the child has stopped loving daddy. rather, it means that her conscious mind is temporarily out of touch with those loving feelings. similarly, a pwbpd will categorize everyone close to her as ""all good"" (""with me"") or ""all bad"" (""against me""). and she will recategorize someone from one polar extreme to the other -- in just seconds -- based solely on a minor comment or action. this b-w thinking also will be evident in her frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions such as ""you never..."" and ""you always...."" because her close friends eventually will be ""split black"" and pushed away, it is unusual for a pwbpd to have any really close long-term friends (unless they live a long distance away) even though she may have many casual friends. **i feel like i need to be treated and will need to get help.** smart idea, sid. again, i suggest you start by seeing a psychologist -- for a visit or two all by yourself -- to obtain a candid professional opinion on what you've been dealing with. whenever strong bpd warning signs are appearing, it is important to see your own psychologist, i.e., one who has not treated or seen your exgf. in that way, you're ensured that the psychologist is ethically bound to protect your best interests, not hers. i mention this because therapists generally are loath to tell a high-functioning pwbpd the name of her disorder. they often decide that it is not in her best interests to be told. **i'm trying to process all of this.** of course, learning to spot bpd warning signs will not enable you to diagnose your exgf's issues. although strong bpd symptoms are easy to spot, only a professional can determine whether they are so severe and persistent as to constitute a full-blown disorder. yet, like learning warning signs for a stroke or heart attack, learning those for bpd may help you avoid a very painful situation -- and can help you decide when professional guidance is needed. i therefore suggest you take a quick look at my list of [18 bpd warning signs]( to see if most sound very familiar. if so and you have questions, sid, i would be glad to discuss them with you.",advice,0,3798.5,687.0,4.0,0.0033030553261767133,0.00495458298926507,0.022295623451692816,0.0,0.0

"comment see the problem with the “fight for our relationship since we’re so close to the altar” thing is that it assumes that getting officially married will somehow magically make all these problems go away. like if you can just push him over that line, he’ll snap back to being on the same page as you as he’s been pretending to all these years. this guy is not a good man. he’s spent 6 years giving you the runaround. he’s gotten you involved in his kinks and now shames you for it. he’s shamelessly telling you that he wants to try and get with a girl nearly half his own age. you can literally see the resentment in his eyes when he looks at you. do you imagine that will change after you’re married? all that will happen is that it will be messier and more expensive to end your relationship once you tie the knot. and god forbid you should bring a child into the world who has a father like this. you’re 35 and you want to have kids. you ain’t got time to waste waiting for a man who has had 6 goddamn years to work through any issues, doubts and concerns he might have about your future together to grow a fucking spine and make a decisive choice. because he won’t. he won’t do the right thing by you. he’s too selfish to even be capable of making such a choice. you have to make it for yourself. end this relationship. make it clear you don’t want to be with someone who could so easily throw you away to chase some random girl who’s barely old enough to drink, and who somehow still doubts your worthiness as a parent even after spending half a decade together. you deserve better than a husband who has kids he doesn’t want and who stuck with you “on balance” because it was less difficult and uncertain than pursuing his midlife crisis dreams. hell, you’d be better off as a single parent through ivf than trying to raise kids with a guy like that. take the money you would have wasted marrying this asswipe and spend it on your own future, hun.",advice,0,1957.0,384.0,0.0,0.0,0.0078125,0.005208333333333333,1.0,0.0
